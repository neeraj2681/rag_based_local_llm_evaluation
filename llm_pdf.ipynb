       " Document(page_content=\"10Introduction\\nA lot has happened since the first version of Day Trading For Dummies came out. We've had a global\\nfinancial crisis. Brokerage firms have introduced smartphone apps for trading. NASDAQ shut down for\\nthree hours due to a systems failure. A new currency, the bitcoin, was invented. The rules of trading\\nhave changed along with all the financial and economic upheaval, and savvy people looking for success\\nin day trading need an up-to-the-minute reference like this new edition to steer them straight.\\nDay trading is a business in which you use real money to take on the markets. If you love the thrill of\\nthe markets and have the patience to sit and stare at a screen for hours, waiting for the right moment to\\nget in and get out of securities, then day trading may be a great career option. But it has risks, too. Any\\nday can be your best day, but it can also put you out of business forever. For that reason, day trading\\nrequires the right psychological makeup. Good day traders are patient and decisive, confident but not\\narrogant. They most certainly are not gamblers, although day trading attracts gamblers who discover it's\\na great way to lose money from home.\\nDay Trading For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is for people who are looking for a new business or who\\nsimply want to supplement their investment returns with new techniques. In this book you can find all\\nthe information you need to determine whether you're cut out for day trading, to lay out your home\\noffice, to research and plan trades, and more. (And even if you decide day trading isn't for you, you can\\nstill find lots of sound general advice about markets, trading, and investing strategies that you can\\nbenefit from. Plus you'll have saved all the money you would have otherwise invested on research and\\ntraining, not to mention the trading losses!)\\nA lot of people make a lot of money selling services to neophyte day traders, claiming to be the best\\nthing going. And maybe so — for some people. In this book, I give a wider perspective. Instead of\\ntelling you to use a particular trading strategy, for example, I help you research and evaluate the\\ndifferent day-trading methods available so that you can find one that works for you. And I also tell you\\nup front that if you decide to day trade, this book shouldn't be your only guide.\\nAbout This Book\\nFirst, let me tell you what this book is not: It's not a textbook, and it's not a handbook for professional\\ninvestors. Several of those are on the market already, and they're fabulous, but they're often dry and\\nassume you already have a lot of knowledge about day trading.\\nThis book doesn't make those assumptions. It contains straightforward explanations of how day trading\\nworks, how to get started, what the pitfalls are, and what some of the alternatives are for your portfolio\\nand for your career. It's designed for you to be able to skip around and read the chapters or sections that\\ninterest you, without having to read every word that comes before them. This book has more than\\nenough content to get you started — or to guide you to something that's a better fit for your sensibilities.\\nIf you really want to read some textbooks, I list a few in the appendix.\\nOh, and I like to think this book isn't dry, either.\\nAs for conventions, here are the basics: I put important words that I define in italics. I often b o l d the\\nkey words of lists to bring the important ideas to your attention. And I place all web addresses in\\nmonofont to set them apart.\\nDuring printing of this book, some of the web addresses may have broken across two lines of text. If\\nyou come across such an address, rest assured that I haven't put in any extra characters (such as\\nhyphens) to indicate the break. When using a broken web address, type in exactly what you see on the\\npage, pretending that the line break doesn't exist.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"1 1I also include sidebars in the book that you don't really need to read in order to follow the chapter text.\\nWith that stated, though, I do encourage you to go back and read through this extra material when you\\nhave the time. Many of the sidebars contain practice examples that help you get an even better idea of\\nhow some of the investment concepts work. Some of the information is pretty fun, too.\\nFoolish Assumptions\\nIn writing this book, I made some assumptions about you, the reader.\\nYou're someone who needs to know a lot about day trading in a short period of time.\\nYou may be considering a career change, looking for a productive part-time retirement activity, or\\nbored and looking for a challenge. Maybe you just want to know if day trading is a good way to\\nsupplement your current investment program. Whatever your reason for considering day trading,\\nyou want to know how to decide whether it's the right option for you.\\nIf you already know that day trading is right for you, you want to know how to get started, from\\nopening an account to setting up your computer monitors. (And yep, that's plural.)\\nYou have extra money to trade (whether it's yours or not) and you want to try day trading\\ntechniques to goose up your portfolio returns.\\nYou have some understanding of the basics of investing — that you know what mutual funds and\\nbrokerage accounts are, for example. If you don't feel comfortable with that much, you may want to\\nread the latest editions of Investing For Dummies (by Eric Tyson, published by Wiley) or Mutual\\nFunds For Dummies (also by Tyson; Wiley) and then come back here. I can wait.\\nIcons Used in This Book\\nAs you read this book, you'll see icons scattered around the margins of the text. Each icon points out a\\ncertain type of information, most of which you should know or may find interesting about day trading.\\nThey go as follows:\\n This icon notes something you should keep in mind about day trading. It may refer to\\nsomething I covered earlier in the book, or it may highlight something you need to remember for\\nfuture investing decisions.\\n Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, and a little more\\nefficiently. The information can help you make better day trades or ask better questions of people\\nwho want to supply you with research, training, and trading systems.\\n I've included nothing in this book that can cause death or bodily harm, as far as I can figure\\nout, but plenty of things in the world of day trading can cause you to lose big money or, worse,\\nyour sanity. These points help you avoid big problems.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"12\\n I put the nonessential (but often helpful) academic stuff here. By reading material marked by\\nthis icon, you get the detailed information behind the investment theories or, sometimes, some\\ninteresting trivia or background information.\\nBeyond the Book\\nIn addition to the book content, you can find a free online Cheat Sheet that includes information on\\naccounts, definitions, indicators, and performance calculation. Go to\\nwww.dummies.com/cheatsheet/daytrading to access this handy reference material, and\\nthen print it out and keep it by your side as you get started.\\nYou can also access additional free articles that cover information I simply couldn't fit into the book.\\nYou'll find information on a day in the life of a trade. I also offer advice about chat rooms and Internet\\nforums and a list of ten alternatives to day trading. You can find them at\\nwww.dummies.com/extras/daytrading.\\nWhere to Go from Here\\nWell, open up the book and get going! If you have a particular area of interest, use the index and table\\nof contents to go to the topic you want. If you're not sure, you can either turn the page and start at the\\nbeginning or flip through and see whether a topic catches your eye.\\nNeed more guidance than that? Then allow me to give you some ideas. You may want to start with\\nChapter 1 if you know nothing about day trading. If you need to get set up to start trading, look at\\nChapters 11 and 12. If you want to know about some of the potential problems in day trading, turn to\\nChapters 4, 14, 15, and 16. If you are thinking about day trading as a career, Chapter 2 describes what\\nday traders do all day. For ideas about developing strategies, whether you're going to hold for a few\\nminutes or several years, go to Part II.\\nBottom line: Anywhere you go, you'll find interesting and useful information.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

Traders work in front of their computer screens, reacting to blips, each\\nof which represents real dollars. They make quick decisions because their ability to make money\\ndepends on successfully executing a large number of trades that generate small profits. They close out\\ntheir positions in the stocks, options, and futures contracts they own at the end of the day, which limits\\nsome of the risks — nothing can happen overnight to disturb an existing profit position — but those\\nlimits on risk can limit profits. After all, a lot can happen in a year, increasing the likelihood that your\\ntrade idea will work out, but in a day? You have to be patient and work fast. Some days offer nothing\\ngood to buy. Other days, every trade seems to lose money.\\nThe individual human-being day trader is up against a tough opponent: high-frequency algorithms\\nprogrammed and operated by brokerage firms and hedge funds that have no emotion and can make\\ntrades in less time than it takes to blink your eye. If you're not prepared for that competition, you will be\\ncrushed.\\nIn this chapter, I cover what day traders do, share the advantages and disadvantages of day trading, list\\nthe personality traits of successful day traders, and give you information on your likelihood of success.\\nYou may find that day trading is a great career option that takes advantage of your street smarts and\\nclear thinking — or that the risk outweighs the potential benefits. Either is okay: The more you know\\nbefore you make the decision to trade, the greater your chance of being successful. If you decide that\\nday trading isn't right for you, you can apply strategies and techniques that day traders use to improve\\nthe performance of your investment portfolio.\\nIt's All in a Day's W ork: Defining Day T rading\\nThe definition of day trading is that day traders hold their securities for only one day. They close out\\ntheir positions at the end of every day and then start all over again the next day. By contrast, swing\\ntraders hold securities for days and sometimes even months; investors sometimes hold for years. The\\nshort-term nature of day trading reduces some risks, because nothing can happen overnight to cause big\\nlosses. Meanwhile, many other types of investors go to bed thinking their position is in great shape only\\nto wake up the next morning to find that the company has announced terrible earnings or that its CEO is\\nbeing indicted on fraud charges.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"16But there's a flip side (there's always a flip side, isn't there?): The day trader's choice of securities and\\npositions has to work out in a day, or it's gone. Tomorrow doesn't exist for any specific position.\\nMeanwhile, the swing trader or the investor has the luxury of time, because it sometimes takes a while\\nfor a position to work out the way your research shows it should. In the long run, markets are efficient,\\nand prices reflect all information about a security. Unfortunately, a few days of short runs may need to\\noccur for this efficiency to kick in.\\n Day traders are speculators working in zero-sum markets one day at a time. That makes the\\ndynamics different from other types of financial activities you may have been involved in. When\\nyou take up day trading, the rules that may have helped you pick good stocks or find great mutual\\nfunds over the years no longer apply. Day trading is a different game with different rules.\\nSpeculating, not hedging\\nProfessional traders fall into two categories: speculators and hedgers. Speculators look to make a profit\\nfrom price changes. Hedgers look to protect against a price change. They make their buy and sell\\nchoices as insurance, not as a way to make a profit, so they choose positions that offset their exposure in\\nanother market.\\nAs examples of hedging, consider a food-processing company and the farmer who raises or grows the\\ningredients the company needs. The company may look to hedge against the risks of price increases of\\nkey ingredients — like corn, cooking oil, or meat — by buying futures contracts on those ingredients.\\nThat way, if prices do go up, the company's profits on the contracts help fund the higher prices it has to\\npay for those ingredients. If the prices stay the same or go down, the company loses only the price of\\nthe contract, which may be a fair tradeoff to the company. The farmer raising corn, soybeans, or cattle,\\non the other hand, benefits if prices go up and suffers if they go down. To protect against a price\\ndecline, the farmer would sell futures on those commodities. His futures position would make money if\\nthe price went down, offsetting the decline on his products. And if the prices went up, he'd lose money\\non the contracts, but that loss would be offset by his gain on his harvest.\\n The commodity markets were intended to help agricultural producers manage risk and find\\nbuyers for their products. The stock and bond markets were intended to create an incentive for\\ninvestors to finance companies. Speculation emerged in all of these markets almost immediately,\\nbut it was not their primary purpose.\\nDay traders are all speculators. They look to make money from the market as they see it now. They\\nmanage their risks by carefully allocating their money, using stop and limit orders (which close out\\npositions as soon as predetermined price levels are reached), and closing out at the end of the night. Day\\ntraders don't manage risk with offsetting positions the way a hedger does. They use other techniques to\\nlimit losses, like careful money management and stop and limit orders (which you can read about in\\nChapter 2).\\n Markets have both hedgers and speculators in them. Knowing that different participants have\\ndifferent profit and loss expectations can help you navigate the turmoil of each day's trading. And\\nthat's important, because to make money in a zero-sum market, you only make money if someone\\nelse loses.\\nUnderstanding zero-sum markets\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n",

If the person who holds an option makes a profit, then\\nthe person who wrote (which is option-speak for sold) that option loses the same amount. There's no net\\ngain or net loss in the market as a whole.\\nNow some of those people buying and selling in zero-sum markets are hedgers who are content to take\\nsmall losses in order to prevent big ones. Speculators may have the profit advantage in certain market\\nconditions, but they can't count on having that advantage all the time.\\nSo who wins and who loses in a zero-sum market? Some days, whether you win or lose all depends on\\nluck, but over the long run, the winners are the people who are the most disciplined: They have a\\ntrading plan, set limits and stick to them, and can trade based on the data on the screen rather than on\\nemotions like hope, fear, and greed.\\nUnlike the options and futures markets, the stock market is not a zero-sum game. As long as the\\neconomy grows, company profits grow, which in turn lead to growing stock prices. The stock market\\nreally has more winners than losers over the long run. That doesn't mean that any given day will have\\nmore winners than losers, however. In the short run, the stock market should be treated like a zero-sum\\nmarket.\\nIf you understand how profits are divided in the markets that you choose to trade, you have a better\\nawareness of the risks that you face as well as the risks that the other participants are taking. People do\\nmake money in zero-sum markets, but you don't want those winners to be making a profit off you.\\nSome traders make money — lots of money — doing what they like. Trading is all about risk and\\nreward. The traders who are rewarded risked the 80 percent washout rate. Knowing that, do you want to\\ntake the plunge? If so, read on. And if not, read on anyway, because you may get some ideas that can\\nhelp you manage your other investments.\\nBeing disciplined: Closing out each night\\nDay traders start each day fresh and finish each day with a clean slate. This daily regimen reduces some\\nof the risk, and it forces discipline. You can't keep your losers longer than a day, and you have to take\\nyour profits at the end of the day before those winning positions turn into losers.\\nThat discipline is important for day traders. When you day trade, you face a market that does not know\\nand does not care who you are, what you're doing, or what your personal or financial goals are. There's\\nno kindly boss who may cut you a little slack today, no friendly coworker to help you through a jam, no\\ngreat client dropping you a little hint about her spending plans for the next fiscal year. Unless you have\\nrules in place to guide your trading decisions, you'll fall prey to hope, fear, doubt, and greed — the Four\\nHorsemen of trading ruin.\\nSo how do you start? First you develop a business plan and a trading plan that reflect your goals and\\nyour personality. Then you set your working days and hours, and you accept that you'll close out every\\nnight. Both of these steps are covered in Chapter 2. As you think about the securities that you'll trade\\n(Chapter 3) and how you may trade them (Part II), you'll also want to test your trading system (Chapter\\n16) to see how it may work in actual trading.\\nIn other words, you prepare and have a plan. That's a basic strategy for any endeavor, whether you're\\nrunning a marathon, building a new garage, or taking up day trading.\\nCommitting to T rading As a Business\\nFor many people, the attraction of day trading is that traders can very much control their own hours.\\nMany markets, like foreign exchange, trade around the clock.

Who are these traders? The professional traders who approach day trading\\nas a business rather than a pastime. They make money when traders who are not fully committed\\nlose their money.\\nBut day trading is a business, and the best traders approach it as such. They have business plans for\\nwhat they will trade, how they'll invest in their business, and how they'll protect their trading profits.\\nTherefore, much of this book is about this business of trading: how to create a business plan (Chapter\\n2), how to set up your office (Chapter 12), tax considerations (Chapter 15), and performance evaluation\\n(Chapter 16). If you catch a late-night infomercial about trading, the story will be about the ease and the\\nexcitement. But if you want that excitement to last, you have to make the commitment to doing trading\\nas a business to which you dedicate your time and your energy.\\nTrading part-time: An okay idea if done right\\nCan you make money trading part-time? You can, and some people do. Successful part-time day traders\\napproach trading as a part-time job, not as a little game to play when they have nothing else going on. A\\npart-time trader may commit to trading three days a week or to closing out at noon instead of at the\\nclose of the market. A successful part-time trader still has a business plan, still sets limits, and still acts\\nlike any professional trader would, just for a smaller part of the day.\\nPart-time trading works best when you can set and maintain fixed business hours. Working on a fixed\\nschedule helps your brain know when to go to work and concentrate on the market, because the habit is\\ningrained. The successful part-timer operates as a professional with fixed hours. Think of it this way:\\nMy son is a patient in a group pediatric practice that has some part-time doctors. These part-time\\ndoctors keep set hours and behave like the other doctors in the practice; the only difference is that they\\nwork fewer hours each week. They commit their attention to medicine when they are on the job, and\\npatients only know about their part-time hours when it comes time to make an appointment. These\\ndoctors don't pop into the office and start giving shots during their lunch break from their “real” job,\\nsneaking around so that their real boss doesn't find out.\\n If you want to be a part-time day trader, approach it the same way that a part-time doctor, part-\\ntime lawyer, or part-time accountant would approach work. Find hours that fit your schedule and\\ncommit to trading during them. Have a dedicated office space with high-speed Internet access and\\na computer that you use just for trading. If you have children at home, you may need to have child\\ncare during your trading hours. And if you have another job, set your trading hours away from\\nyour work time. Trading via cellphone during your morning commute is a really good way to lose\\na lot of money (not to mention your life if you try it while driving).\\nTrading as a hobby: A bad idea\\nBecause of the excitement of day trading and the supposed ease of doing it, you may think that day\\ntrading makes a great hobby.

Making a lot of money the first time trading and\\nthen assuming that all such successes will come as easily. That first success was almost definitely\\ndue to luck, and that luck can turn against a trader on a dime. If you make money your first time\\nout, take a step back and see whether you can figure out why. Then test your strategy, using\\nChapter 16 as a guide, to see whether your strategy is a good one that you can use often.\\nYes, I have two warnings in this section, and for good reason: Successful day traders commit to their\\nbusiness. Even then, most day traders fail in their first year. Brokerage firms, training services, and\\nother traders have a vested interest in making trading seem like an easy activity that you can work into\\nyour life. But it's a job — a job that some people love, but a job nonetheless.\\n If you really love the excitement of the markets, you can find ways to invest on a hobbyist's\\nschedule: You can spend your time doing fundamental research to find long-term investments (see\\nChapter 17 for information on that); you can look into alternative investments to help diversify\\nyour portfolio (head to Chapter 3); and you can trade with play money, either in demo accounts or\\nin trading contests, to try trading without committing real money.\\nDefining the Principles of Successful Day\\nTrading\\nAlthough you can day trade almost every asset with wild abandon, doing so probably isn't a good idea.\\nSome traders spend their entire careers working with just one or two types of securities. This section\\ncovers the basics of success: working with just a few assets in one market, managing positions carefully,\\nand concentrating on the work at hand.\\nWorking with a small number of assets\\nMost day traders pick one or two markets and concentrate on those to the exclusion of all others. That\\nway they can learn how the markets trade, how news affects prices, and how the other participants react\\nto new information. Also, concentrating on just one or two markets helps a trader maintain focus.\\nAnd what do day traders trade? Chapter 3 has information on all of the different markets and how they\\nwork, but here's a quick summary, in no particular order, of the most popular assets with day traders\\nright now:\\nFinancial futures: Futures contracts allow traders to profit from price changes in such market\\nindexes as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. They give traders exposure to the\\nprices at a much lower cost than buying all the stocks in the index individually. Of course, they tend\\nto be more volatile than the indexes they track because they are based on expectations.\\nForex: Forex, short for foreign exchange, involves trading in currencies all over the world to profit\\nfrom changes in exchange rates.

The borrowings\\nhave to be repaid no matter what happens to the trade, which adds to the risk of forex.\\nCommon stock and exchange-traded funds: The entire business of day trading began in the stock\\nmarket, and the stock market continues to be popular with day traders. They look for news on\\ncompany performance and investor perception that affect stock prices, and they look to make\\nmoney from those price changes. A similar asset is the exchange-traded fund, which trades like a\\nstock but is based on a market index or strategy. The big drawback? Stock and ETF traders can get\\nkilled at tax time if they aren't careful. See Chapter 15 for more information.\\nManaging your positions\\nA key to successful trading is knowing how much you're going to trade and when you're going to get\\nout of your position. Sure, day traders are always going to close out at the end of the day — or they\\nwouldn't be day traders — but they also need to cut their losses and take their profits as they occur\\nduring the day. Specifically, they need to determine the size of the trade and the maximum profit or loss:\\nDetermining what portion of their money they risk for any particular trade: Traders rarely\\nplace all their money on one trade. That's a good way to lose it! Instead, they trade just some of\\ntheir money, keeping the rest to make other trades as new opportunities in the market present\\nthemselves. If any one trade fails, the trader still has money to place new trades. Some traders\\ndivide their money into fixed proportions, and others determine how much money to trade based on\\nthe expected risk and expected return of the security they're trading. Careful money management\\nhelps a trader stay in the game longer, and the longer a trader stays in, the better the chance of\\nmaking good money. Chapter 6 has more information on money-management strategies.\\nProtecting their funds by using stop and limit orders: Stop and limit orders are placed with the\\nbrokerage firm and kick in whenever the security reaches a predetermined price level. If the\\nsecurity starts to fall in price more than the trader likes — bam! — it's sold, and no more losses will\\noccur on that trade. The trader doesn't agonize over the decision or second-guess herself. Instead,\\nshe just moves on to the next trade, putting her money to work on a trade that's likely to be better.\\n Day traders make a lot of trades, and a lot of those trades are going to be losers. The key is to\\nhave more winners than losers. By limiting the amount of losses, the trader makes it easier for the\\ngains to be big enough to generate more than enough money to make up for the losers.\\nFocusing your attention\\nDay traders are often undone by stress and emotion. Keeping a steady eye on what's happening in the\\nmarket is hard when you're looking at screens all day and working alone. But as a trader, you have to be\\nable to concentrate on the market and stick to your trading system, staying as calm and rational as\\npossible.\\nDay traders who do well have support systems in place. They are able to close their positions and spend\\nthe rest of the day on other activities. They do something to get rid of their excess energy and clear their\\nminds, such as running or yoga or meditation. They understand that their ability to maintain a clear\\nmind when the market is open is crucial.\\nTraders sometimes think of the market itself, or everyone else who is trading, as the enemy. The real\\nenemies are emotions: doubt, fear, greed, and hope.

That's why having a plan\\nand concentrating on what works for you are so important.\\nIdentifying the Personality T raits of Successful\\nDay T raders\\nSuccessful traders are a special breed. They can be blunt and crude, because they act fast against a\\nmarket that has absolutely no consideration for them. For all their rough exterior, they maintain strict\\ndiscipline about how they approach their trading day and what they do during market hours.\\nThe discipline begins with a plan for how to start the day, including reviews of news events and trading\\npatterns. It includes keeping track of trades made during the day, to help the trader figure out what\\nworks and why. And it depends on cutting losses as they occur, reaping all profits that appear, and\\nrefining a set of trading rules so that tomorrow will be even better. No, this strategy isn't as much fun as\\njust jumping in and placing orders, but it's more likely to lead to success.\\nNot everyone can be a day trader, nor should everyone try it. In this section, I cover some of the traits\\nthat the best day traders possess.\\nIndependence\\nFor the most part, day traders work by themselves. Computers and monitors are relatively inexpensive,\\nhigh-speed Internet connectivity is easier to get, and many brokerage firms cater to the needs of traders\\nwho are working by themselves — all of which leaves the day trader at home, alone, stuck in a room\\nwith nothing but the computer screen for company. Being alone all day may be boring and make it hard\\nto concentrate. Some people can't handle it.\\nBut other traders thrive on being alone all day, because it brings out their best qualities. They know that\\ntheir trading depends on them alone, not on anyone else. The trader has sole responsibility when\\nsomething goes wrong, but he also gets to keep all the spoils. He can make his own decisions about\\nwhat works and what doesn't, with no pesky boss or annoying corporate drone telling him what he\\nneeds to do today.\\nIf the idea of being in charge of your own business and your own trading account is exciting, then day\\ntrading may be a good career option for you.\\n What if you want to trade but don't want to work by yourself? Consider going to work for a\\nbrokerage firm, a hedge fund, a mutual fund, or a commodities company. These businesses need\\ntraders to manage their own money, and they usually have large numbers of people working\\ntogether on their trading desks to share ideas, cheer each other on, and give each other support\\nwhen things go wrong.\\n No matter how independent you are, your trading will benefit if you have friends and family to\\noffer you support and encouragement. That network can help you better manage the emotional\\naspects of trading.

Well, of course some decisions are going to be bad. That's the risk\\nof making any kind of an investment, and without risk, there is no return.

The first is the use\\nof stop and limit orders, which automatically close out losing positions.

For this reason, the stock market isn't a zero-sum market, like options and futures\\nmarkets. In the stock market, the odds are ever so slightly in the trader's favor.\\n In all markets, the prepared and disciplined trader can do better than the frantic, naïve trader.\\nThat's not the case when gambling, because no matter how prepared the gambler is, the casino has\\nthe upper hand.\\n People with gambling problems sometimes turn to day trading as a socially acceptable way to\\nfeed their addiction.

Anyone who buys a day-trading DVD course\\nvia infomercial can make money easily in just a few hours a week, right? Well, no. Day trading is a job.\\nIt can be a full-time job or a part-time job, but it requires the same commitment to working regular\\nhours and the same dedication to learning a craft and honing skills as any other job.\\nThe best traders have plans for their business and for their trades. They know in advance how they want\\nto trade and what they expect to do when they face the market. They may, at times, find themselves\\ndeviating from their plans, due to luck or circumstance or changing markets, but in those cases, they\\nunderstand why they're trying something else.\\nTrading comes in many flavors, and many of those who call themselves day traders are actually doing\\nother things with their money. If you know in advance what you want to do, not only will you be less\\nlikely to panic or follow fads, but you'll also be in a better position to take advantage of opportunities in\\na way that suits your personality, trading skills, and goals. And that's why this entire chapter is devoted\\nto planning.\\n Failing to plan is planning to fail. And if you can't remember that right now, don't worry. I\\nrepeat it several times in this book.\\nPlanning Y our T rading Business\\nThe day trader is an entrepreneur who has started a small business that trades in securities in hopes of\\nmaking a return. You can get your business off to a good start if you have a plan for what you want to\\ndo and how you're going to do it. With a plan, you know what your goals are and what you need to do to\\nachieve them.\\nYou can find a lot of sample business plans in books and on the Internet, but most of them are not\\nappropriate for a trader. A typical business plan is designed to not only guide the business but also to\\nattract outside financing. Unless you're going to take in partners or borrow money from an outside\\nsource, your day trading business plan is only for you. No executive summary and no pages of\\nprojections needed.\\nSo what do you need instead? How about a list of your goals and a plan for what you'll trade, what your\\nhours will be, what equipment you'll need, and how much to invest in the business? The following\\nsections have the details.\\nSetting your goals\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n",

Here is a\\nsample list of key questions to get you started:\\nWhere do you want to be with your career and your life in the next three months, six months, nine\\nmonths, year, three years, five years, and ten years?\\nHow many days a year do you want to trade?\\nWhat do you need to know to trade better?\\nHow much do you want to make?\\nWhat will you do with your profits?\\nHow will you reward yourself when you hit your goals?\\nBe as specific as possible when you think about what you want to do with your trading business and\\ndon't worry if your business goals overlap with your personal goals.

And if you don't meet your goal, how will you know\\nhow to make changes?\\nFinding volatility\\nYou can day trade so many different securities and derivatives! Sure, you want to trade anything that\\nmakes money for you, but what on earth is that? Each market has its own nuances, so if you flit from\\nfutures to forex (foreign exchange), you may be courting disaster. But if you know what markets you\\nwant to trade, you have a better sense of what research services you need, what ongoing training you\\nmay want to consider, and how to evaluate your performance.\\nChapter 3 covers different asset classes in great detail and discusses how you may use them. For now,\\nthe little cheat sheet in Table 2-1 lists asset classes that are most popular with day traders. Think about\\nyour chosen markets in the same way: What do you want to trade, where will you trade it, what is the\\nrisk and return, and what are some of the characteristics that make this market attractive to you?\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 27}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"28\\nWhat do zero sum, leverage, and upward bias mean? Well, zero sum means that for every winner, there\\nis a loser. The market has no net gain. Leverage is the use of borrowed money, which increases potential\\nreturn as well as risk. Upward bias means that, in the long run, the market is expected to increase in\\nprice, but that doesn't mean it will go up on any given day that you're trading.\\nThe characteristics of the different markets and assets affect both your business plan and your trading\\nplan. The business plan should include information on what you'll trade and why, as well as what you\\nhope to learn to trade in the future. The trading plan looks at what you want to trade each day and why\\nso that you can channel your efforts.\\n Many day traders work in several different markets, depending on their temperament and\\ntrading conditions, but successful traders have narrowed the field down to the few markets where\\nthey want to concentrate their efforts. Start slowly, working just one or two different securities,\\nand consider adding new markets as your experience and trading capital grows.\\nFixing hours, vacation, and sick leave\\nThe markets are open more or less continuously. Although many exchanges have set trading hours, you\\ncan find traders working after hours who are willing to sell if you want to buy. Some markets, such as\\nforeign exchange, take only the briefest of breaks over the course of a week, which gives day traders\\nincredible flexibility. No matter what hours and what days are best for you to trade, you can find\\nsomething that works for you. If you're sharpest in the evenings, for example, you may be better off\\ntrading Asian currencies, because those markets are active when you are. Of course, an always-open\\nmarket can be a disadvantage, because no one is setting limits for you. Few markets are great places to\\ntrade every hour of every day.\\nIf you want to, you can trade almost all the time. But you probably don't want to. To keep your sanity,\\nmaintain your perspective, and have a life outside of your trading, you should set regular hours and stick\\nto them. In your business plan, determine when you're going to trade, how often you're going to take a\\nvacation, how many sick days you'll give yourself, and how you'll know to take a day off. One of the\\njoys of self-employment is that you can take time off when you need to, so give yourself that little perk\\nin your business plan.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n",

(Chapter 12 has\\nsome ideas on that subject.) What can you afford now, and what is on your wish list? Do you have\\nenough computing equipment, the right Internet connection, and a working filing system? Determining\\nwhat you have and how you'll get what you need is part of your plan for getting your business\\nunderway, so put some thought into your infrastructure.\\nAnd yes, setting up business space and investing in equipment are important. You don't want to lose a\\nday of trading because your computer crashes, nor do you want to be stuck with an open position\\nbecause your Internet service provider has a temporary outage. And you certainly don't want to lose\\nyour concentration because you're trying to work in the family room while other members of your\\nhousehold are playing video games.\\nInvesting in your business\\nYou won't have the time and money to do everything you want to do in your trading business, so part of\\nyour business plan should include a list of things that you want to add over time. A key part of investing\\nin your business is continuous improvement: No matter how good a trader you are now, you can always\\nbe better. Furthermore, the markets are always changing. New products come to market, new trading\\nregulations are passed, and new technologies appear. You need to continuously absorb new things, and\\npart of your business plan should consider that. Ask yourself\\nWhat percentage of your time and trade gains will go into expanding your knowledge of trading?\\nDo you want to gain this additional knowledge by taking seminars or by allocating the time to\\nsimulation test (head to Chapter 16 for more on that)?\\nWhat upgrades will you make to your trading equipment? How about to your programming\\ncapabilities?\\nHow are you going to set yourself up to stay in trading for the long haul?\\n It takes money to make money — another cliché. This maxim doesn't mean, however, that you\\nshould spend money willy-nilly on any nifty gadget or fancy video seminar that comes your way.\\nInstead, it means that an ongoing, thoughtful investment in your trading business will pay off in a\\ngreater likelihood of long-run success.\\nEvaluating and revising your plan\\nOne component of your business plan should be a plan for revising it. Things are going to change. Since\\nthe first edition of this book came out, exchanges have merged, the market has crashed, and high-\\nfrequency trading has become the norm. You may be more or less successful than you hope, market\\nconditions may change on you, and you may simply find out more about how you trade best. So set a\\nplan for updating your business plan to reflect where you are and where you want to be as you go along.\\nAt least once a year, and more often if you feel the need for a change, go through your business plan\\nand revise it to reflect where you are now.

I have $50,000 in capital that I can risk without affecting my\\nlivelihood. I will rely on my spouse's job to cover our family spending needs and our health insurance.

I will have lost no more than $5,000 of my trading capital.\\nIn nine months, I will be trading daily, and I will have more winning trades than losing trades.\\nIn a year, I will have gained 10 percent on my account. I will withdraw $1,000 to pay toward our mortgage\\nand another $1,000 toward an ergonomic chair and other office equipment upgrades. I will have learned to\\nprogram, mastered my first trading system, and will be testing a second one in order to expand my trading\\nopportunities.\\nIn three years, my trading account will have $150,000 in it from my trading successes, after making\\ninvestments in my business and paying an additional $10,000 in principal on the mortgage. I will be\\ntrading three different systems with satisfactory success.\\nIn five years, I will have $300,000 in my trading account. I will have made enough money to have paid off\\nour mortgage, after making regular payments on principal and interest every month, paying $10,000 in\\nyear three, and paying off the rest with the profits that I expect to earn between years three and five. I will\\nbe known as a successful trader.\\nIn ten years, I will have a second house, and I will continue my record of trading success. I will take\\n$100,000 out of my trading account to cover college tuition.\\nMarkets Traded\\nMy primary trading strategy will involve momentum trades on the E-Mini S&P 500 and E-Mini NASDAQ\\nfutures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. I will put no more than 10 percent of my\\ncapital into any one trade, and I will close out positions each night.\\nI am interested in news-driven swing trading (holding for short periods of time but longer than a day) in\\nlarge technology companies, so I will research and test strategies with those. I am also interested in\\ntrading Asian currencies, so I will make time to learn more about those markets and determine whether I\\ncan trade them effectively during my preferred trading hours.\\nTrading Hours and Days\\nBecause my primary strategy is equity driven, I will trade only while the equity markets are open, from\\n9:30 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. I will spend an hour before the markets open\\nresearching current trends and news events so that I know what people will be looking for that day.

She knows what she wants to trade and how to trade it. She knows what her\\nlimits are before she places the order. She's not afraid to take a loss now in order to prevent a bigger loss\\nin the future, and she's willing to sit out the market if nothing is happening that day. Her plan gives her\\nthe discipline to protect her capital so that she has money in her account when the opportunities present\\nthemselves.\\nIn this section, I cover the components of trade planning. When you start trading, you'll probably write\\nnotes each day to set up a trading plan that covers what you expect for the day, what trades you hope to\\nmake, and what your profit goals and loss limit are. As you develop experience, trade planning may\\nbecome innate. You develop the discipline to trade according to plan without needing to write it all\\ndown — although you may find it useful to tape a list of the day's expected announcements to your\\nmonitor.\\n Like a business plan, a trading plan is flexible. The markets don't know what you've planned,\\nand you'll probably end up deviating on more than one occasion. The key thing is knowing why\\nyou deviated: Was it because of the information that you saw when you were looking at your\\nscreen, or was it because you became panicky?\\nWhat do you want to trade?\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"32The first step in your trading plan should also be addressed in your business plan: What do you want to\\ntrade? Many traders work in more than one market, and each market is a little different. Some trade\\ndifferent products simultaneously, whereas others choose one for the day and work only on that.\\nYou need to figure out which markets give you the best chance of getting a profit that day, and this\\nchanges regularly. Some days, no trades will be good for you in one market, and you'll be better off\\nsitting out. If you're too antsy to sit out, then find another market to keep you busy so that you don't\\ntrade just to stay awake. (Of course, many traders report that the big money opportunities are in the\\nslower, less glamorous markets.)\\n As a day trader, you're self-employed. You don't answer to a boss, and you don't have to trade\\non any particular day if you don't want to. So if you have a headache, if no good trades are\\navailable to you, or if recent losses have gotten you down, take the day off and do something fun.\\nHow do you want to trade?\\nFiguring out how to trade an asset involves a lot of considerations: What is your mood today? What will\\nother traders be reacting to today? How much risk do you want to take? How much money do you want\\nto commit? These considerations represent the nitty-gritty stage of trade planning that can help you\\nmanage your market day better.\\nStarting the day with a morning review\\nBefore you start trading, take some time to determine where your head is relative to the market. Is today\\na day that you can concentrate? Are things happening in your life that may distract you, are you coming\\ndown with the flu, or were you out too late last night? Or are you raring to go, ready to take on whatever\\nthe day brings? Your mindset should influence how aggressively you want to trade and how much risk\\nyou want to take. You have to pay attention to do well in the markets, but you also have to know when\\nto hang back during the day's activities. For example, many traders find that their strategies work best at\\ncertain times of the day, such as at the open or before major news announcements.\\nAfter you determine your own mindset, think about what people will be reacting to that day. Go through\\nthe newspapers and check the online newswires to gather information. Then figure out the answers to\\nthese questions:\\nAre big news announcements scheduled for today? At what time? Do you want to trade ahead of\\nthe news, or do you want to wait and see what the market does?\\nDid something happen overnight? Will that event affect trading on the open, or is it already in the\\nmarkets? Do you want to trade on the open or wait?\\nWhat are the other people — those who trade the same future, commodity, stock, or currency that\\nyou do — worried about today? How are they likely to respond? Do you want to go with the market\\nor strike a contrary position?\\nDrawing up a sample order\\nAfter you have a sense of how you're going to tackle the day, determine how much you're going to\\ntrade. Following are the key considerations:\\nDo you want to be long or short? That is, do you want to bet that the asset you are trading is going\\nup in price or down?\\nDo you want to borrow money? If so, how much? Borrowing — also known as margin or\\nleverage — increases your potential return as well as your risk.

Ah, but if deciding when\\nto buy and sell were easy, do you think I'd be revising a book on day trading? No. I'd be too busy taking\\nprivate surfing lessons in front of my beachfront mansion on Maui.\\n The very best traders aren't selling trading advice, because they're already retired. Everyone\\nelse is figuring it out as they go along, with varying degrees of success.\\nMany traders rely on technical analysis, which involves looking at patterns in charts of the price and\\nvolume changes (I discuss technical analysis in Chapter 7). Other traders look at news and price\\ninformation as the market changes rather than looking at price patterns (you can find a discussion of this\\nin Chapter 8). Still others care only about very short-term price discrepancies (covered in Chapter 10).\\nBut the most important thing, no matter what approach you prefer, is that you backtest and simulate\\nyour trading before you commit real dollars. That way, you have a better sense of how you'll react in\\nreal market conditions. You can find backtesting in Chapter 16.\\nSetting profit goals\\nWhen you trade, you want to have a realistic idea how much money you can make. What's a fair profit?\\nDo you want to ride a winning position until the end of the day, or do you want to get out quickly after\\nyou make enough money to compensate for your risk? This question has no one single answer because\\nso much depends on market conditions and your trading style. In this section are some guidelines that\\ncan help you determine what's best for you.\\nYour profit goals can be sliced and diced a few different ways. The first is the gain per trade on both a\\npercentage basis and an absolute basis. The second is the gain per day on both a percentage basis and an\\nabsolute basis. What do you have to do to reach these goals? How many successful trades will you have\\nto make? Do you have the capital to do that? And what is right for the trade you are making right now,\\nregardless of what your longer-term goals are?\\nThe language of money\\nProfits are discussed differently in different markets, and you may as well have the right lingo when you\\nwrite your plan:\\nPennies: Stocks trade in decimal form, so each price movement is worth at least a penny — one\\ncent. It's an obvious way to measure a profit.\\nPips: A pip is the smallest unit of currency that can be traded. In foreign exchange markets (forex),\\na pip is gener ally equal  to one one-hundredth of a cent. If the value of the euro moves from\\n$1.2934 to $1.2935,  it has moved a pip.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"34Note: Do not confuse a pip in the forex market with an investment scheme known as PIP,\\nsometimes called People in Profit or Pure Investor. (The fraud also operates as HYIP, for High\\nYield Investment Program.) PIP has been promoted as a trading system with a guaranteed daily\\nreturn, but it's really a pyramid scheme that takes money from participants and returns little or\\nnothing. You can get more information from the SEC's website,\\nhttp://sec.gov/divisions/enforce/primebank.shtml.\\nPoints: A point is a single percentage. A penny  is a point, as is a 1 percent change in a bond\\nprice. A related number, a basis point, is a percent of a percent, or 0.0001.\\nTeenies: Many securities, especially bonds  and derivatives on them, trade in increments of ⅛ of a\\ndollar. Half of an eighth is a sixteenth, also known as a teeny .\\nTicks: A tick is the smallest trading increment in a futures contract. It varies from product to\\nproduc t. How much it works out to be depends on the contract structure. For the CME Group's E-\\nMini S&P 500 contract, a tick is equal  to $12.50, calculated as a 0.25 change in the underlying\\nS&P 500 index  multiplied by $50 multiplier. A tick on an E-Mini soybean contract is $1.25,\\ncalculated as ⅛ cent on a bushel of soybeans in a contract covering 1,000 bushels. You can get\\ninformation on the tick size of contracts that interest you on the website of the offering exchange\\n(exchanges  are listed in Chapter 3).\\n No one ever lost money taking a profit, as the cliché goes. (The trading business is rife with\\nclichés, if you haven't noticed.) The newer you are to day trading, the more sense it makes to be\\nconservative. Close your positions and end your day when you reach a target profit and then make\\nnote of what happens afterward. Can you afford to hold on to your positions longer to make a\\ngreater profit?\\nSetting limits on your trades\\nSetting a loss limit along with a profit goal is a good idea. For example, many futures traders have a rule\\nto risk two ticks in pursuit of three ticks. That means that they'll sell a position as soon as it loses two\\nticks in value and as soon as it gains three ticks in value. And for anything in between? Well, they close\\nout their positions at the end of the day, so whatever happens happens.\\nEven traders who do not have a rule like that often set a limit on how much they'll lose per trade. Other\\ntraders use computer programs to guide their buys and their sells, so they sell their positions\\nautomatically. Brokers make setting limits easy by giving customers the choice of a stop order or a limit\\norder to protect their positions.\\n You want to limit your loss per trade as well as your loss per day. If today is not a good one,\\nclose up shop, take a break, and come back fresh tomorrow.\\nStop orders\\nA stop order is an order to buy or sell a security as soon as a security moves beyond the current market\\nprice. A stop buy order is set above the current market price, and it is used to manage a short position. A\\nstop sell order is set at a price below where the market is now, and it is used to protect a profit or limit a\\nloss on a security that you already own. If you want to make sure you sell a block of stock when it falls\\nbelow $30 per share, for example, you can enter a stop order at $30 (telling your broker “Sell Stop 30”).\\nAs soon as the stock hits or goes below $30, the broker sells it, even if the price goes to $29 or $31\\nbefore all the stock is sold. This is often known as a stop loss order.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"35A version of a stop, known as a trailing stop, is used to help protect a profit.

If you bought a block of stock at $30 with a\\ntrailing stop of $5, for example, the stop would kick in at $25. But if your trade was a good one and the\\nstock went from $30 to $35, the stop would trail with it and rise to $30, a price $5 below the current\\nmarket value.\\nLimit orders\\nA limit order is an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better: lower than the current price\\nfor the buy order (because you want to buy low, naturally), higher than the specific price for a sell order\\n(because you want to sell high).\\nIf you want to make sure you sell a block of stock when it's at $30 per share, for example, you can enter\\na limit order at $30 (telling your broker, “Sell Limit 30”). As soon as the stock hits $30, the broker sells\\nit, continuing to place the order as long as the price stays at $30 or higher. If the price goes even a penny\\nbelow $30, the limit is no longer enforced, and the broker stops selling your position. After all, no\\nbuyers are going to want to pay an above-market price just so you can get your order completed!\\nStop-limit orders\\nA stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. It tells the broker to buy or sell at a\\nspecific price or better but only after the price passes a given stop price. If, for example, you want to\\nmake sure you sell a block of stock when it falls below $30 per share but you also want to make sure\\nyou sell it only when you'd have a loss, you can enter a stop order at $30 with a limit of $29 (telling\\nyour broker, “Sell 30 Limit 29”). As soon as the stock hits $30, the broker sells it as long as the price\\nstays above $29. If it goes below $29, the broker stops selling. Stop-limit orders help you get out\\nwithout maximizing your losses; the danger, of course, is that the stock goes to $6 and you could have\\ngotten out at $28 without the stop-limit order.\\nAre you confused? Well, the differences may be confusing, but understanding them is important to\\nhelping you manage your risks.

The limit sets an automatic exit point when your\\nposition hits your price target, and the stop-loss kicks in if your trade moves against you in order to\\nlimit your losses. The broker will execute only the relevant order, cancelling the other order when that\\nhappens. If not, the other half of the order will be hanging out, waiting to be executed, causing you\\nheadaches.\\nOrder sends other\\nDepending on who you talk to, OSO stands for order sends order, order sends other, or one sends other.\\nThey all mean the same thing: When one order is executed, another order is automatically entered into\\nthe system — and not a moment before.

Closing out at the end of\\nthe day is important for a few reasons:\\nClosing out daily reduces your risk of something happening overnight.\\nMargin rates — the interest rates paid on money borrowed for trading — are low and in some cases\\nzero for day traders, but the rates go up on overnight balances.\\nGood trade discipline is what can keep you from making expensive mistakes.\\nBut like all rules, the single-day rule can be broken and probably should be broken sometimes. In this\\nsection, I cover a few longer-term trading strategies that you may want to add to your trading business\\non occasion.\\nSwing trading: Holding for days\\nSwing trading involves holding a position for several days. Some swing traders hold overnight, while\\nothers hold for days or even months. The longer time period gives more time for a position to work out,\\nwhich is especially important if the position is based on news events or if it requires taking a position\\ncontrary to the current market sentiment. Although swing trading gives traders more options for making\\na profit, it carries some risks because the position can turn against you while you are away from the\\nmarkets.\\n A tradeoff always exists between risk and return. When you take more risk, you do so in the\\nhopes of getting a greater return. But when you look for a way to increase return, remember that\\nyou have to take on more risk to do it.\\nSwing trading requires paying attention to some basic fundamentals and news flow. (Fundamental\\nresearch is discussed in Chapter 7.) It's also a good choice for people who have the discipline to go to\\nbed at night instead of waiting up and watching their position in hopes that nothing goes wrong.\\nPosition trading: Holding for weeks\\nA position trader holds a stake in a stock or a commodity for several weeks and possibly even for\\nmonths. This person is attracted to the short-term price opportunities, but he also believes that he can\\nmake more money holding the stake for a long enough period of time to see business fundamentals play\\nout. Position trading increases the risk and the potential return because a lot more can happen over\\nmonths than minutes.\\nInvesting: Holding for months or years\\nAn investor is not a trader. Investors do careful research and buy a stake in an asset in the hopes of\\nbuilding a profit over the long term.

Will it hold its value? They view short-term price fluctuations as noise rather than as profit\\nopportunities.\\nMany traders pull out some of their profits to invest for the long term (or to give to someone else, such\\nas a mutual-fund manager or hedge fund, to invest). Doing so is a way of building financial security in\\nthe pursuit of longer goals. This money is usually kept separate from the trading account.\\nMaxims and Clichés That Guide and Mislead\\nTraders\\nIn this chapter, I cover a few of the many maxims traders use to think about their trading, such as\\nThe stock doesn't know you own it.\\nFailing to plan is planning to fail.\\nYour first loss is your best loss.\\nA lot more are out there.\\nClichés are useful shorthand for important rules that can help you plan your trading. But they can also\\nmislead you because some are really obvious — too obvious to act on effectively. Yes, everyone knows\\nthat you make money by buying low and selling high, but how do you tell what low is and high is?\\nHere's a run-through of some clichés that you'll come across in your trading career, along with my take\\non what they mean.\\nPigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered\\nTrading is pure capitalism, and people do it for one primary reason: to make money. Sure, a ton of\\neconomic benefits come from having well-functioning capital markets, such as better price prediction,\\nrisk management, and capital formation. But a day trader just wants to make money.\\nGet too greedy, however, and you're likely to get stupid. You start taking too much risk, deviating too\\nmuch from your strategy, and getting careless about dealing with your losses. Good traders know when\\nit's time to take a profit and move on to the next trade.\\nThis maxim is one of those obvious but tough-to-follow ones. After all, when do you cross the line from\\nbeing a happy little piggy to a big fat greedy hog that's about to be turned into a pork belly? Just know\\nthat if you're deviating from your trading plan because things are going so great, you may be headed for\\nsome trouble.\\nHere's a cliché that's related to “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered”: “Bears get fat, bulls get fat, and\\nhogs get slaughtered.” In other words, a savvy trader can make money whether the market is up or\\ndown, but a greedy trader runs into trouble.\\nIn a bear market, the money returns to its rightful owners\\nA bull market is one that charges ahead; a bear market is one that does poorly. Many people\\nerroneously think of themselves as trading geniuses because they make money when the entire market is\\ngoing up. Making money by day trading was easy with Internet stocks in 1999, but it wasn't so easy in\\n2000 when the bubble burst.

       " Document(page_content=\"40trading and who know how to manage risk are able to stay in until things get better, possibly even\\nmaking nice profits along the way.\\nThe corollary cliché for “In a bear market, the money returns to its rightful owners,” is “Don't confuse\\nbrains with a bull market.” When things are going well, watch out for overconfidence. It may be time to\\nupdate your business and trading plans, but it's not to time cast them aside.\\nThe trend is your friend\\nWhen you day trade, you need to make money fast. You do not have the luxury of waiting for your\\nunique, contrary theory to play out. An investor may be buying a stock in the hopes of holding it for\\ndecades, but a trader needs things to work now.\\n Given the short-term nature of the market, short-term sentiment is going to trump long-term\\nfundamentals. People trading today may be wrong about the direction of foreign exchange,\\ninterest rates, or stock prices, but if you are closing out your positions tonight, you need to work\\nwith the information in the market today. In the short run, traders who fight the market lose\\nmoney.\\nThere are two problems with the maxim “The trend is your friend.” The first is that by the time you\\nidentify a trend, it may be over. Second, sometimes, going against the herd makes sense because you\\ncan collect when everyone else realizes their mistake. In such a situation, the psychology of trading\\ncomes into play. Are you a good enough judge of human behavior to know when the trend is right and\\nwhen it's not?\\nBuy the rumor, sell the news\\nMarkets react to information. That's ultimately what drives supply and demand. Although the market\\ntends to react quickly to information, it can overreact, too. Lots of gossip gets traded in the markets as\\neveryone looks to get the information they need to gain an advantage. And despite such things as\\nconfidentiality agreements and insider-trading laws, many rumors turn out to be true.\\nThese rumors are often attached to such news events as corporate earnings. For whatever reason —\\ngood news, analyst research, a popular product — traders may believe, for example, that the company\\nwill report good quarterly earnings per share. That's the rumor. If you buy on the rumor, you can take\\nadvantage of the price appreciation as the story gets more play. When the earnings are actually\\nannounced, one of two things will happen:\\nThe earnings will be as good as or better than rumored, and the price will go up. The trader can sell\\ninto that and make a profit.\\nThe earnings will be worse than rumored, everyone will sell on the bad news, and the trader will\\nwant to sell to get out of the loss.\\nOf course, if the rumor is bad, you want to do the opposite: sell on the rumor and buy on the news. For\\nmore information on short selling — selling securities in hopes that they fall in price — turn to Chapter\\n9.\\nThe problem with “Buy the rumor, sell the news” is that rumors are often wrong, and there may be more\\nopportunities to buy on bad news when other traders are panicking, thus driving prices down for a few\\nminutes before sanity sets in. But this rule is one of those that everyone talks about, whether or not they\\nactually follow it.\\nCut your losses and ride your winners\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 40}),\n",

No matter\\nhow much it hurts and no matter how much you believe that you're right, you need to close out a losing\\nposition and move on.\\nBut the opposite — that you should ride your winners — is not necessarily true. Although good traders\\ntend to be disciplined about selling winning positions, they don't use stops and limits as rigorously on\\nthe upside as they may on the downside. They're likely to stick with a profit and see how high it goes\\nbefore closing out a position.\\nNote that this conflicts a little with the “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered” maxim. (Trading maxims can\\nbe so contradictory!) To prevent overconfidence and sloppiness from greed, ride your winners within\\nreason. If your general discipline is to risk three ticks on a futures contract to make five, and a contract\\ngoes up six ticks before you can close it out, you may want to stick with it. But if you also close out at\\nthe end of every day, don't give in to the temptation of keeping that position open just because it's still\\ngoing up. Keep to your overall discipline.\\nYou're only as good as your last trade\\nThe markets churn on every day with little regard for why everyone trading right now is there.

No, it just means\\nthat the markets won this time around.\\n Most day traders work in zero-sum markets, where for every winner, there's a loser. Hence, not\\neveryone can make money every day. The challenge is to maintain an even keel so as not to be\\ndistracted by confidence when the trading is going well or by fear when the trading is going\\npoorly.

Stocks, corn, or bitcoins? You have myriad choices, but you have to\\nchoose so that you can learn the market, know what changes to expect, and make your trades\\naccordingly. And to avoid the devilment of the wash-sale rule, which can limit the tax deductibility of\\nshort-term losses (and which you can read about in Chapter 15), you probably want to make your\\nuniverse of trading assets to be as broad as possible.\\nStill, you can't trade everything. A day has only so many hours, and your head can hold only so many\\nideas at any one time. Furthermore, some trading strategies lend themselves better to certain types of\\nassets than others (see Chapter 8). By finding out more about all the various investment assets available\\nto a day trader, you can make better decisions about what you want to trade and how you want to trade\\nit.\\nDefining a Good Day-T rading Asset\\nIn academic terms, the universe of investable assets includes just about anything you can buy at one\\nprice and sell at another, potentially higher price. Artwork and collectibles, real estate, and private\\ncompanies, for example, are all considered to be investable assets.\\nDay traders have a much smaller group of assets to work with. Expecting a quick, one-day profit on\\nprice changes in real estate isn't realistic. Online auctions for collectible items take place over days, not\\nminutes. If you're going to day trade, you want to find assets that trade easily, several times a day, in\\nrecognized markets. In other words, you want liquidity. As an individual trading your own account, you\\nwant assets that you can purchase with relatively low capital commitments. And finally, you may want\\nto use leverage — borrowed money — to improve your return, so you want to look for assets that can\\nbe purchased using other people's money. The following sections outline the characteristics of good\\nassets for day trading.\\nLooking for liquidity\\nLiquidity is the ability to buy or sell an asset in large quantity without affecting the price levels. Day\\ntraders look for liquid assets so they can move in and out of the market quickly without disrupting price\\nlevels. Otherwise, they may not be able to buy at a good price or sell when they want.\\nAt the most basic level, financial markets are driven by supply and demand.

In a perfect market, the amount of supply and demand is matched so that prices don't change.\\nThis situation occurs if a high volume of people are trading such that the supply and demand are\\nconstantly matched or if the frequency of trades is very low, which keeps the price from changing.\\n You may be thinking, wait, don't I want big price changes so that I can make money quickly?\\nYes, you want price changes in the market, but you don't want to be the one causing them. The\\nless liquid a market is, the more likely your buying and selling are to affect market prices, and the\\nsmaller your profit will be.\\nVolume\\nVolume is the total amount of a security that trades in a given time period. The greater the volume, the\\nmore buyers and sellers are interested in the security and the more easily you can get in there and buy\\nand sell without affecting the price.\\nDay traders also look at the relationship between volume and price. This important technical indicator is\\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter 7. Here's the simple analysis:\\nHigh volume with no change in price levels means an equal match between buyers and sellers.\\nHigh volume with rising prices means that buyers outnumber sellers, so the price will continue\\ngoing up.\\nHigh volume with falling prices means that sellers outnumber buyers, so the price will keep going\\ndown.\\nFrequency\\nAnother measure of liquidity is frequency, or how often a security trades. Some assets, like stock market\\nfutures, trade constantly, from the moment the market opens until the very last trade of the day, and then\\ncontinue into overnight trading. Others, like agricultural commodities, trade only during market hours\\nor only during certain times of the year. Other securities, like stocks, trade frequently, but the volume\\nrises and falls at regular intervals related to such things as options expiration (the date at which options\\non the stock expire).\\nMuch of the market is dominated by high-frequency traders, which are proprietary computerized\\nsystems that enter, execute, or cancel buy and sell orders in the blink of an eye — or less. These traders\\nhave thrown a wrench into a few trading days, but they are only partially responsible for the type of\\nfrequency being discussed here. That's because high-frequency traders look for securities that already\\ntrade frequently to make the programs work better.\\nHoming in on high volatility\\nThe volatility of a security is how much the price of an asset varies over a period of time. It tells you\\nhow much prices fluctuate and thus how likely you are to be able to take advantage of that. For\\nexample, if a security has an average price of $5 but trades anywhere between $1 and $14, it is more\\nvolatile than one with an average price of $5 that trades between $4 and $6.\\nOne standard measure of volatility and risk is standard deviation, which is how much any given price\\nquote varies from a security's average price. If you are dying to see it, the math is explained in the\\nsidebar “Finding the standard deviation — the hard way,” but you can calculate it with most spreadsheet\\nprograms and many trading platforms.\\nFinding the standard deviation — the hard way\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"44Here's the equation you use to calculate standard deviation:\\nIn this equation, N is the number of price quotes, x1 is any one price quote, and the funky x with the line\\nover it is the average of all the prices over time.\\nTo calculate standard deviation for yourself, you calculate the difference between any given price and the\\naverage value. So if the average price is $5 and the closing price today is $8, the difference is $3. (More\\nlikely, the research service that you use would calculate the difference for you; you can learn more about\\nresearch services in Chapter 13.)\\nAfter you have all the differences between the prices and the average for the time period in question, you\\nfind the square of these differences. If the difference for one day's price is $8, then the square is $64. You\\nadd up all the squared differences over the period of time that you are looking at and then find the\\naverage of them. That number is called the v a r ia n c e , or σ2. Finally, calculate the square root of the\\nvariance, and you have the standard deviation.\\n The higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility; the higher the volatility, the more a\\nsecurity's price is going to fluctuate, and the more profit — and loss — opportunities there are for\\na day trader.\\nStandard deviation is also a measure of risk that can be used to evaluate your trading performance. That\\nuse of the measure is discussed in Chapter 16.\\nStaying within your budget\\nYou don't necessarily need a lot of money to begin day trading, but you do need a lot of money to buy\\ncertain securities. Stocks generally trade in round lots, which are orders of at least 100 shares. If you\\nwant to buy a stock worth $40 per share, you need $4,000 in your account. Your broker will probably let\\nyou borrow half of that money, but you still need to come up with the other $2,000.\\nOptions and futures trade by contract; one contract represents some unit of the underlying security. For\\nexample, in the options market, one contract is good for 100 shares of the stock. These contracts also\\ntrade in round lots of 100 contracts per order.\\n No one will stop you from buying a smaller amount than the usual round lot in any given\\nsecurity, but you'll probably pay a high commission and get worse execution for your order.\\nBecause the returns on each trade tend to be small anyway, don't take up day trading until you\\nhave enough money to trade your target asset effectively. Otherwise, you'll pay too much to your\\nbroker without getting much for yourself.\\nBonds do not trade in fractional amounts; they trade on a per-bond basis, and each bond has a face value\\nof $1,000. Some trade for more or less than that, depending on how the bond's interest rate differs from\\nthe market rate of interest, but the $1,000 figure is a good number to keep in mind when thinking about\\ncapital requirements. Many dealers have a minimum order of ten bonds, though, so a minimum order\\nwould be $10,000.\\nMaking sure you can use margin\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 44}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"45Most day traders make money through a large volume of small profits. One way to increase the profit\\nper trade is to use borrowed money to buy more shares, more contracts, or more bonds. Margin is\\nmoney in your account that you borrow against, and almost all brokers will be happy to arrange a\\nmargin loan for you, especially if you're going to use the money to make more trades and generate more\\ncommissions for the brokerage firm. In Chapter 9, I discuss how margin is used within an investment\\nstrategy. Here, though, you want to think about how margin affects your choice of assets for day\\ntrading.\\nThe following section gives you more information on how margin works and what you need to consider\\nwhen selecting assets to trade, but here's what you need to know now: Most stocks and bonds are\\nmarginable (able to be purchased on margin), and the Federal Reserve Board allows traders to borrow\\nup to 50 percent of their value. But not all securities are marginable. Stocks priced below $3 per share,\\nthose traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or OTC Link (discussed later in this chapter), and those in\\nnewly public companies often cannot be borrowed against or purchased on margin. Your brokerage firm\\nshould have a list of securities that are not eligible for margin.\\n If leverage is going to be part of your day-trading strategy, be sure that the assets you plan to\\ntrade are marginable.\\nGenerally, your stock or bond account must hold the greater of $2,000 or 50 percent of the purchase\\nprice of securities when you borrow the money. So, for example, if you want to buy $5,000 worth of\\nsomething on margin, you need to have $2,500 in your account. The price of those securities can go\\ndown, but if they go down so much that the account now holds only 25 percent of the value of the loan,\\nyou'll get a margin call. That means that you have to add cash or securities to your account right then\\nand there. If not, your position will be liquidated.\\nExcess margin is the amount of money in your account over and above the minimum. For example, if\\nyou have $100,000 in your account and need 30 percent as maintenance margin, then you can borrow\\nagainst an additional $70,000, the amount in excess of the 30 percent used for maintenance.\\nFor derivatives, the margin rules are a bit different. Each contract has its own requirement for the initial\\nmargin and maintenance levels that must be kept on account; in the argot of the derivatives markets,\\nmargin is also known as a performance bond. If you are trading the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's E-\\nmini MSCI Emerging Markets index contracts, for example, your initial margin per contract is $10,000,\\nand your maintenance margin is $8,000. You can find current margin requirements for Chicago\\nMercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade products at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's\\nwebsite, www.cmegroup.com.\\n Margin requirements aren't set by the brokerage firms. Instead, the minimum amount in your\\naccount — and thus the maximum amount you can borrow — is set by the Federal Reserve Board\\nunder Regulation T. That's because of concerns that if too much borrowing takes place, the\\nborrowers will panic in a financial downturn and drag the market down even further. (Excessive\\ntrading on margin was a contributing factor to the stock market crash of 1929, in which the Dow\\nJones Industrial Average fell 13 percent in one day, and the market did not fully recover until\\n1954. The financial crisis of 2008 wasn't caused by leverage in the stock market but by excessive\\nborrowing in the real estate market.)\\nChanging margin rules for pattern day traders\\nFINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority that oversees the activities of member brokerage\\nfirms (which pretty much includes every brokerage firm in the United States), has rules about margin\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 45}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"46for day trading accounts to help brokerage firms manage their risks while accommodating the needs of\\nactive customers. Their rules complement those of the Federal Reserve Bank.\\nThe FINRA regulations include a category of brokerage customer known as the pattern day trader.\\nThese are folks who day trade, which FINRA defines as buying, selling or selling short, and then\\nbuying the same security on the same day four or more times in five business days. Furthermore, pattern\\nday traders, according to FINRA, make enough day trades that they constitute more than 6 percent of\\ntheir total trading activity for that same five-day period. Brokerage firms can classify customers as\\npattern day traders before they make a single trade. For example, if the firm offers you special training\\nor services designed for active traders, it may put you into that category.\\nPattern day traders have to meet a different margin requirement. They need to start the trading day with\\nat least $25,000 in cash and securities and maintain that amount throughout the trading day. The reason\\nfor these requirements is that margin requirements for other customers are based on the value of the\\naccount at the end of the day, but most day traders close out their positions overnight, which means that\\nfirms weren't managing their intra-day risk. Having the minimums in place helps protect the broker, but\\nit also limits how much you can borrow if you have less than $25,000 in your day-trading account.\\nBeing a pattern day trader under FINRA offers some advantages, the greatest one being that you can\\nborrow more money during the day. Meet the standards, and you're allowed to borrow four times your\\nexcess margin as long as you close your trades out at the close of the market or before. A regular\\ncustomer can only borrow one times the excess. If you exceed your margin limit, you have five days to\\ndeposit more cash or securities in your account.\\nObeying your brokerage firm's margin policies\\nThe Fed limits the amount that can be borrowed, and FINRA monitors how member brokerage firms\\ncomply. All brokerage firms have to meet those rules, but some set stricter limits for their customers.\\nThe brokerage firms also set the interest rates for margin and the requirements for customers who want\\nto borrow money to trade. The rates can be high; in 2013, brokerage firm Charles Schwab charged an\\nannual rate of 8 percent on margin loans between $25,000 and $49,999.\\nDay traders have to pay margin interest, even though their loans are of short duration. Because it takes\\nthree days for a securities trade to settle, to the accountants, it looks as though you borrowed the money\\nfor three full days, not three hours. Some brokerage firms charge you interest for the full three days.\\n You won't pay the quoted interest rate each day, however; the quoted rate is almost always\\nannualized. Divide it by 365 to find the daily rate. If the annual rate is 8.00 percent, then the daily\\nrate will be 8.00 ÷ 365 = 0.02 percent. Check with your brokerage firm to find out the specifics of\\nthe margin interest calculation for day traders so that you understand what you'll be charged\\nbefore you start to trade.\\nTrading T ypes of Securities\\nIn the financial markets, people buy and sell securities every day, but just what are they buying or\\nselling? Securities are financial instruments. In the olden days, they were pieces of paper, but now they\\nare electronic entries that represent a legal claim on some type of underlying asset. This asset may be a\\nbusiness, if the security is a stock, or it may be a loan to a government or a corporation, if the security is\\na bond. In this section, I cover different types of securities that day traders are likely to run across and\\ntell you what you need to jump into the fray.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 46}),\n",

But to be precise, these three are not the same:\\nAn asset is a physical item. Examples include a company, a house, gold bullion, or a loan.\\nA security is a contract that gives someone the right of ownership of the asset, such as a share of\\nstock, a bond, a promissory note.\\nA derivative is a contract that draws its value from the price of a security. Examples include options\\nand futures.\\nStocks\\nA stock, also called an equity, is a security that represents a fractional interest in the ownership of a\\ncompany. Buy one share of Microsoft, and you are an owner of the company, just as Bill Gates is. He\\nmay own a much larger share of the total business, but you both have a stake in it. Stockholders elect a\\nboard of directors to represent their interests in how the company is managed. Each share is a vote, so\\ngood luck getting Bill Gates kicked off Microsoft's board.\\nA share of stock has limited liability, which means that you can lose all of your investment but no more\\nthan that. If the company files for bankruptcy, the creditors cannot come after the shareholders for the\\nmoney that they are owed.\\nSome companies pay their shareholders a dividend, which is a small cash payment made out of firm\\nprofits. Because day traders hold stock for really short periods of time, they don't normally collect\\ndividends.\\nHow U.S. stocks trade\\nStocks are priced based on a single share, and most brokerage firms charge commissions on a per-share\\nbasis. Despite this per-share pricing, stocks are almost always traded in round lots of 100 shares. The\\nsupply and demand for a given stock is driven by the company's expected performance.\\nA stock's price is quoted with a bid and an ask.\\nThe bid is the price that the broker pays to buy the stock from you if you are selling.\\nThe ask is the price that the broker charges you if you are the one buying.\\n You can remember the difference between the bid and the ask this way: The broker buys on the\\nbid. Let alliteration be your friend!\\nThe difference between the bid and the ask is the spread, and that represents the dealer's profit.\\nHere is an example of a price quote:\\nMSFT $31.60 $31.61\\nThis quote is for Microsoft (ticker symbol: MSFT). The bid, listed first, is $31.60, and the ask is $31.61.\\nThat's the smallest spread you'll ever see! The spread here is so small because Microsoft is a liquid\\nstock, and no big news events are going on that may change the balance of buyers and sellers.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

Many novice day\\ntraders focus on the amount of the commission and forget that some brokerage firms can execute\\nthe order better than others, thus keeping the spread narrower. You need to consider the total cost\\nof trading when you design a trading strategy and choose a brokerage firm, and brokers must\\ndisclose data on trade execution quality if you request it.\\n I tend to use the words broker and dealer interchangeably, but there is a difference. A broker\\nsimply matches buyers and sellers of securities, whereas a dealer buys and sells securities out of\\nits own account. Almost all brokerage firms are both brokers and dealers.\\nWhere U.S. stocks trade\\nU.S. stocks trade mostly on organized exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ,\\nbut they trade more and more on electronic communications networks, some of which are operated by\\nthe exchanges themselves.\\nThe old-line exchanges are what you may think about when someone mentions stock exchanges: brick-\\nand-mortar buildings with lots of people running around to execute trades in person. They are still major\\nfactors in the market, but they have competition from electronic communication networks, which were\\ncreated with the theory being that more competition would make markets function even better. It hasn't\\nquite worked out that way. Spreads between bid and ask prices have narrowed, but volatility has\\nincreased since they became a factor in the market. On the other hand, volatility creates opportunity for\\nday traders, so that's not necessarily a bad thing.\\nWhen you place an order with your brokerage firm, the broker's computer executes that order wherever\\nit can get the best deal. But is that the best deal for you or the best deal for the brokerage firm? It's tough\\nto know the right answer. In general, firms that do more trading and participate in several exchanges and\\nelectronic communications networks can get you the best execution.

By the time you read the information here, things may have changed again, which I\\nthink is fascinating. It wasn't so long ago that these exchanges were staid organizations run like\\nprivate clubs.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\\nThe New York Stock Exchange is the most famous of all stock exchanges. Most of the largest U.S.\\ncorporations trade on it, and they pay a fee for that privilege.\\nTo be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, a company generally needs to have at least 2,200\\nshareholders excluding insiders, trade at least 100,000 shares a month for the last six months, carry a\\nmarket capitalization (number of shares outstanding multiplied by price per share) of at least $100\\nmillion, and post total pre-tax earnings of $10 million over the previous three years.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange is more than 200 years old, but it has been going through some big\\ncorporate changes in order to stay relevant. It's a floor-based exchange. The trading area is a big open\\nspace in the building, known as the floor. The floor broker, who works for the member firm, receives the\\norder electronically and then takes it over to the trading post, which is the area on the floor where the\\nstock in question trades.

In 2007, it merged with Euronext, a holding company for five different\\nEuropean securities exchanges. Then NYSE Euronext bought the American Stock Exchange, once a\\nmajor competitor to the NYSE, and phased it out. The combined company offers stock, bond, and\\nderivates trading in person at the remaining physical exchanges and electronically through Arca, its\\nelectronic exchange. Of course, the percentage of trading that has been done by actual people standing\\non the floor of an actual building has fallen steadily over the years. Most trading is done electronically\\nby small day traders and big institutions alike, with almost 30 percent of trading executed by computer\\nalgorithms.\\nTo give you a clue about the importance of computerized trading, the NYSE allows brokerage firms to\\nplace their servers on the floor of the exchange — for a fee, of course. For some, the millisecond\\nadvantage is worth it.\\nNASDAQ\\nNASDAQ used to stand for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation\\nSystem, but now it's just a name, not an acronym, pronounced just like it's spelled. When NASDAQ\\nwas founded, it was an electronic communication network (more on those shortly) that handled\\ncompanies that were too small or too speculative to meet New York Stock Exchange listing\\nrequirements. What happened was that brokers liked using the NASDAQ network, and technology\\ncompanies on the exchange (Microsoft, Intel, Apple) that were once small and speculative became huge\\ninternational behemoths.\\nWhen a customer places an order, the brokerage firm's computer looks to see whether a matching order\\nis on the network. Sometimes, the order can be executed electronically; in other cases, the brokerage\\nfirm's trader needs to call other traders at other firms to see whether the price is still good. A key feature\\nof NASDAQ is its market makers, who are employees of member brokerage firms who agree to buy\\nand sell minimum levels of specific stocks in order to ensure that some basic level of trading is taking\\nplace.\\nNASDAQ divides its listed companies into three categories:\\nThe NASDAQ Global Select Market includes the 1,000 largest companies on the exchange.\\nCompanies that make the list have a minimum average market capitalization of $550 million and\\ntotal earnings of at least $11 million in the prior three fiscal years.\\nThe NASDAQ Global Market includes companies that are too small for the Global Select Market\\nbut that aren't exactly small. To make the Global Market, companies generally need to have a\\nmarket capitalization of at least $75 million, at least 1.1 million shares outstanding, at least 400\\nshareholders, and a minimum price per share of $4.\\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market is for companies that do not qualify for the NASDAQ Global\\nMarket. To qualify here, companies need a market capitalization of at least $50 million, at least 1\\nmillion shares outstanding, about 300 shareholders, and a minimum price per share of $4.\\n As a day trader, you'll find that NASDAQ Global Select Market companies are the most liquid.\\nYou may also notice changes in trading patterns when a company is close to being moved between\\ncategories.

       " Document(page_content=\"50NASDAQ was the first electronic stock exchange, but it's now an institution. Several new exchanges\\nhave emerged to compete with the NYSE and NASDAQ. These firms usually started at electronic\\ncommunications networks but grew enough to become something else. They have created new trading\\nopportunities and reduced costs, but they have also added to the volatility in the market. The following\\nsections discuss the two electronic exchanges in the stock market now.\\nBATS Exchange\\nBATS (www.batstrading.com) stands for Better Alternative Trading System. It was founded to\\nimprove trade execution times, and it is now the third-largest exchange in the U.S. Several exchange-\\ntraded funds are listed directly on BATS. The exchange had tried to offer stock listings, too, beginning\\nwith its own IPO, but a trading system failure stopped the IPO and scaled back those ambitions — at\\nleast for now.\\nNational Stock Exchange\\nThe National Stock Exchange has its roots in the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, which was founded in\\n1885. It converted to all-electronic in 1980 and is now owned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange\\nand a group of brokerage firms. It is an electronic communications network that trades all exchange-\\nlisted equities, but it does not list securities on its own.\\nThe high-risk over-the-counter exchanges\\nWhen the traditional floor-based exchanges were the primary game, a few companies emerged to trade\\nstocks that were not eligible for exchange listing. These businesses are still around, and many traders\\nlike them because they can find stocks that have good volatility that are too small to attract the attention\\nof the big guys with their big computers. However, the risk level is a lot higher: Some of these stocks\\ndon't trade enough for a day trader, and a few of these stocks are not issued by legitimate companies.\\nOver-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC BB)\\nThe Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board is the market for companies that are reporting their financials to\\nthe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission but that don't qualify for listing in any NASDAQ\\ncategory. It also includes some foreign issuers that have not received listing in a U.S. market. American\\nBulletin Board companies have four-letter ticker symbols followed by .OB. For example, Sanborn\\nResources ticker symbol is SANB.OB. Foreign issuers trade with five-letter symbols, four letters\\nfollowed by an F. ACS Motion Control, based in Israel, trades as ACSEF.\\nBrokerage firms carry quotations on OTC BB stocks through their NASDAQ workstations or other\\nquotation services, enabling them to find current prices and locate buyers and sellers for any orders that\\nthey have. Quotes are also posted on the OTC BB website, www.otcbb.com.\\n In many cases, OTC BB companies are those that used to be on NASDAQ, but the stock prices\\nhave lost too much of their value to maintain their listing. A Bulletin Board listing is often a last\\nhurrah before oblivion.\\nOTC Link\\nOnce upon a time, few electronic networks existed, and they didn't have enough room for many\\ncompanies to trade on them. Smaller companies did not trade daily. To find current prices, brokerage\\nfirms subscribed to a price service that sent out a weekly newsletter listing the prices for those\\ncompanies. The newsletter was printed on pink paper, so it became known as the Pink Sheets. In the\\nmore modern era, the newsletter has moved online and changed its name to OTC Link\\n(www.otcmarkets.com).\\nOTC Link does not have listing requirements for companies. Most of the companies don't qualify for\\nlisting on the NASDAQ or OTC BB, usually because they aren't current on their filings with the\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.

Orders for OTC Link companies are placed\\nthrough brokerage firms who use the service to find prices and match buyers and sellers.\\n Not all OTC Link companies are legitimate. Because of the minimal listing requirements, it\\ntends to be the hangout for penny stocks (those trading at less than $1.00 per share), fraudulent\\ncompanies, and securities that are easily manipulated by boiler-room operators. It can be a tough\\ncrowd, and a lot of people get burned.\\nDark pools\\nDon't be put off by the word dark — dark pools, also known as dark liquidity, are good for traders.\\nThese exchanges allow people to place buy and sell orders that will be executed only if someone takes\\nthe other side. Of course, that's how most markets operate, but dark pools don't publish the prices or the\\nsizes of the orders. Traders use them for low-cost execution, not price discovery. The downside is that\\nprice listings carry information about where the market is headed.\\nBonds\\nA bond is a loan. The bond buyer gives the bond issuer money. The bond issuer promises to pay interest\\non a regular basis. The regular coupon payments are why bonds are often called fixed income\\ninvestments. Bond issuers repay the money borrowed — the principal — on a predetermined date,\\nknown as the maturity. Bonds generally have a maturity of more than ten years; shorter-term bonds are\\nusually referred to as notes, and bonds that mature within a year of issuance are usually referred to as\\nbills. Most bonds in the United States are issued by corporations (corporate bonds) or by the Federal\\ngovernment (Treasury bonds). Some are issued by local governments (municipal bonds).\\nOver the years, enterprising financiers realized that some investors needed regular payments but others\\nwanted to receive a single sum at a future date. So they separated the coupons, the interest payments on\\na bond, from the principal. The principal payment, known as a zero-coupon bond, is sold to one\\ninvestor, while the coupons, called strips, are sold to another investor. The borrower makes the\\npayments just like with a regular bond. (Regular bonds, by the way, are sometimes called plain vanilla.)\\nThe borrower who wants to make a series of payments with no lump-sum principal repayment would\\nissue an amortizing bond to return principal and interest on a regular basis. If you think about a typical\\nmortgage, the borrower makes a regular payment of both principal and interest. This way, the amount\\nowed gets smaller over time so that the borrower does not have to come up with a large principal\\nrepayment at maturity.\\nOther borrowers prefer to make a single payment at maturity, so they issue discount bonds. The\\npurchase price is the principal reduced by the amount of interest that otherwise would be paid.\\n If a company goes bankrupt, the bondholders get paid before the shareholders do. In some\\nbankruptcies, the bondholders take over the business, leaving the current shareholders with\\nnothing.\\nHow bonds trade\\nBonds often trade as single bonds, with a face value of $1,000, although some brokers take on only\\nminimum orders of ten bonds. Bonds do not trade as frequently as stocks do because most bond\\ninvestors are looking for steady income, so they hold their bonds until maturity. Bonds have less risk\\nthan stocks, so they show less price volatility. The value of a bond is mostly determined by the level of\\ninterest rates in the economy.

If traders don't think that the\\nbond issuer will pay up, then the bond price will fall.\\n Generally speaking, only corporate and municipal bonds have repayment risk. The U.S.\\ngovernment could default, but that scenario is unlikely as long as the government can print money.\\nMost international government bonds have similarly low default risk, but some countries have\\ndefaulted. The most notable was Russia, which refused to print money to repay its debts in the\\nsummer of 1998 — a decision that caused huge turmoil in the world's financial markets, including\\nthe collapse of a major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.\\nInvestment banks and the federal government sell new bonds directly to investors. After they are issued,\\nbonds are said to trade in the secondary market; some are listed, and some trade over-the-counter,\\nmeaning dealers trade them among themselves rather than over an organized exchange.\\nA bond price quote looks like this:\\n0.125 July 14 n 99:98 99:99\\nTranslation: This bond is a U.S. Treasury note maturing in July 2014 and carrying an interest rate of\\n0.125 percent. Similar to stocks, the numbers right after the n (for note) list the bid and ask. The first\\nnumber is the bid, the price that the dealer pays to buy the bond from you if you are selling. The second\\nnumber is the ask, the price that the dealer charges you if you're buying. The difference is the spread,\\nand that's the dealer's profit.\\n Most bonds are not suitable for day traders. Only Treasury bonds, issued by the U.S.\\ngovernment, have enough consistent trading volume to attract a day trader. Because of the capital\\nrequired to trade and the relatively low liquidity of many types of bonds, many traders prefer to\\nuse futures to bet on interest rates. I discuss futures in detail later in this chapter.\\nIf you're one of those day traders who wants to buy or sell bonds anyway or if you just want to know\\nmore about the market, then read on.\\nListed bonds\\nSome larger corporate bonds are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Those wanting to buy or sell\\nthem place an order through their brokerage firm, which sends an order to the floor broker. The process\\nis almost identical to the trading of listed stocks.\\nOver-the-counter trading\\nMost corporate and municipal bonds trade over-the-counter, meaning no organized exchange exists.\\nInstead, brokerage firms use electronic price services to find out where the buyers and sellers are for\\ndifferent issues. Over-the-counter bonds don't trade much. Buyers often give their quality, interest rate,\\nand maturity requirements to their broker, and the broker waits until a suitable bond comes to market.\\nTreasury dealers\\nUnlike the corporate and municipal bond market, the Treasury market is one of the most liquid in the\\nworld. The best way to buy a new Treasury bond is directly from the government because no\\ncommission is involved. You can get more information from the Treasury Department's website,\\nwww.treasurydirect.gov; it has information on all kinds of government bonds for all kinds of\\npurchasers.\\nAfter the bonds are issued, they trade on a secondary market of Treasury dealers.

If your brokerage firm is not a Treasury dealer, it has a relationship with one that\\nit can send your order to.\\nTreasury dealers do quite a bit of day trading in Treasury bonds for the firm's own account. After all, the\\nmarket is liquid enough that day trading is possible. Few individual day traders work the Treasury\\nmarket, though, because it requires a great deal of capital and leverage to make a high return.\\nExchange-traded funds (ETFs)\\nExchange-traded funds (or ETFs) are a cross between mutual funds and stocks, and they offer a great\\nway for day traders to get exposure to market segments that may otherwise be difficult to trade. The\\ncategory is sometimes called exchange-traded products because some of the funds are structured more\\nas a trading strategy than as mutual funds. A money-management firm buys a group of assets — stocks,\\nbonds, or others — and then lists shares that trade on the market. In most cases, the purchased assets are\\ndesigned to mimic the performance of an index, and investors know what those assets are before they\\npurchase shares in the fund. The big advantage for day traders is that an ETF can be bought or sold at\\nany time during the trading day, long or short, with cash or on margin, through a regular brokerage\\naccount. This flexibility is great for day traders.\\nAlthough an ETF looks a little bit like an index mutual fund or a market index futures contract, it has a\\nvery different structure. ETFs have two types of shares, creation units and retail shares:\\nCreation units: These shares are held by authorized participants, which are different trading and\\nbrokerage firms that agree to commit cash to the fund. Creation unit holders can exchange their\\nshares for the actual securities held in the fund, or they can add the appropriate securities to the\\nfund in order to make new creation units. They do this to keep the value of the ETF in line with the\\nunderlying market index. So if the price of an ETF falls below the value of the securities in it, the\\nauthorized participants will trade in their creation units for the securities and then sell them on the\\nopen market. If the price of an ETF rises above the value of the securities, then the authorized\\nparticipants will buy up the securities and exchange them for more creation units that they can sell\\nat a nice profit.\\nRetail shares: These ETF shares are listed on the exchange to be bought and sold by regular\\ninvestors and traders. If you day trade ETFs, you'll be working with the retail shares.\\nMost of the time, the price of both the creation units and the retail shares are right in line with the price\\nof the securities. On occasion, though, the value of the ETF and its investments will diverge. For\\nexample, on May 6, 2010, the U.S. stock market had a major break. Late in the trading day, the Dow\\nJones Industrial Average fell almost 1,000 points and then recovered almost right away. The cause was a\\nsingle large sale of futures contracts, but it did a lot of disruption. Stock prices fell and then rebounded\\nso quickly that ETF pricing couldn't keep up. ETF traders had a difficult time determining when to buy\\nand when to sell because fund valuations were just wrong. It added more uncertainty to an already\\nrough afternoon.\\nTraditional ETFs are available on the big market indexes, like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the Dow\\nJones Industrial Average. They are also available in a variety of domestic bond indexes, international\\nstock indexes, foreign currencies, and commodities. Because traders are often interested in a market\\nsegment that doesn't have an index on it, some ETF companies develop their own niche indexes and\\nissue ETFs based on them. Hence, you can find ETFs for such markets as green energy and Islamic\\ninvesting. The liquidity in the securities in the underlying index may be low, though, so these funds may\\nbe more volatile in trading — and may even have arbitrage opportunities.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 53}),\n",

Customers place orders, usually in round lots, through their\\nbrokerage firms. The price quotes come in decimals and include a spread for the dealer.\\nWhere U.S. exchange-traded funds trade\\nThe firm that sets up the exchange-traded fund gets to choose the market where it trades, as long as the\\nfund meets the exchange's requirements for size, liquidity, and financial reporting. Exchange-traded\\nfunds trade anywhere that listed stocks trade.\\nCashing In with Currency , the Big Kahuna\\nCash is king, as they say. It's money that's readily available in your day-trading account to buy more\\nsecurities. For the most part, the interest rate on cash is very low, but if you close out your positions\\nevery night, you'll always have a cash balance in your brokerage account. The firm will probably pay\\nyou a little interest on it, so it will contribute to your total return, but not by much.\\nBut one type of cash investment can be really exciting for a day trader, and that's currency. Every day,\\ntrillions (yes, that's trillions with a t) of dollars of currency are exchanged between governments, banks,\\ntravelers, businesses, and speculators. With every trade and every blip in exchange rates, you have new\\nopportunities to make money. Currency is a bigger, more liquid market than the U.S. stock and bond\\nmarkets combined. It's often referred to as the forex market, short for foreign exchange. Foreign\\ncurrency may be an attractive place to store some of your trading cash, and it can be a great asset to day\\ntrade.\\nHere's another neat thing about the currency market: Some types of currency trades are tax free. (Taxes\\nare covered in more detail in Chapter 15.) These trades are usually longer-term, involving the currency\\nitself, not day trades and not trades in the futures or forward market. But still — tax free! In other\\nwords, don't get suckered by ads for currency trading firms that promise tax-free income until you read\\nthe fine print.\\nHow currency trades\\nThe exchange rate is the price of money. It tells you how many dollars it takes to buy yen, pounds, or\\neuros. The price that people are willing to pay for a currency depends on the investment opportunities,\\nbusiness opportunities, and perceived safety in each nation. If American businesses see great\\nopportunities in Thailand, for example, they have to trade their dollars for baht in order to pay rent, buy\\nsupplies, and hire workers there. This situation increases the demand for baht relative to the dollar and\\ncauses the baht to go up in price relative to the dollar.\\nExchange rates are quoted on a bid-ask basis, just as bonds and stocks are. A quote may look like this:\\nUSDJPY=X 97.3150 97.5250\\nThis is the exchange rate for converting the U.S. dollar into Japanese yen.

When you exchange money to go on vacation in a foreign land, you are exchanging on the\\nspot, and you are allowed to do it as a trader or as an investor. Day traders can also use currency\\nexchange-traded funds (discussed earlier in this chapter) or currency futures (discussed later in this\\nchapter) to profit from the changing prices of money.\\nWhere currency trades\\nSpot currency — the real-time value of money — does not trade on an organized exchange.

You can get more\\ninformation at https://bitcoinfoundation.org.\\nConsidering Commodities and How They T rade\\nCommodities are basic, interchangeable goods sold in bulk and used to make other goods. Examples\\ninclude oil, gold, wheat, and lumber. Commodities are popular with investors as a hedge against\\ninflation and uncertainty. Stock prices can go to zero, but people still need to eat! While commodity\\nprices usually tend to increase at the same rate as in the overall economy, meaning they maintain their\\nreal (inflation-adjusted) value, they can also be susceptible to short-term changes in supply and demand.\\nA cold winter increases demand for oil, a dry summer reduces production of wheat, and a civil war\\ncould disrupt access to platinum mines.\\nDay traders aren't going to buy commodities outright. If you really want to haul bushels of grain around\\nall day, you can do that without taking on the risks of day trading (you'd get more exercise, too).\\nInstead, day traders who want to play with commodities can look to other investments. The most\\npopular way is to buy futures contracts, which change in price with the underlying commodity\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 55}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"56(discussed later in this chapter). Increasingly, many people trade commodities through exchange-traded\\nfunds that are based on the value of an underlying basket of commodities.\\n Commodity prices affect the broad economy, not just the prices of commodities contracts on\\nthe futures exchanges. If you day trade stocks in particular, you may find that changes in the price\\nof oil or agricultural commodities affect many of the companies that you are involved with as well\\nas the broader stock market indexes.\\nDealing in Derivatives\\nDerivatives are financial contracts that draw their value from the value of an underlying asset, security,\\nor index. For example, an S&P 500 futures contract gives the buyer a cash payment based on the price\\nof the S&P 500 index on the day that the contract expires. The contract's value thus depends on where\\nthe index is trading. You're not trading the index itself; instead, you're trading a contract with a value\\nderived from the price of the index. The index value changes all the time, so day traders have lots of\\nopportunities to buy and sell.\\nMany day traders choose derivatives because these products give traders access to much of the\\neconomic universe, including stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. Furthermore, derivatives may\\nhave more favorable tax treatment for day traders than many other assets; more than one new day trader\\nplaying the stock market has been burned by the so-called wash-sale rule, which limits the deductibility\\nof short-term losses. (I discuss this rule in Chapter 15.) Futures aren't subject to wash-sale rules. Read\\non to find out more and see if they are right for you!\\nGetting to know types of derivatives\\nDay traders are likely to come across three types of derivatives: options, futures, and warrants. Options\\nand futures trade on dedicated derivatives exchanges, whereas warrants trade on stock exchanges.\\nOptions\\nAn option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the\\nunderlying asset at an agreed-upon price at an agreed-upon date in the future. An option that gives you\\nthe right to buy is a call, and one that gives you the right to sell is a put. A call is most valuable if the\\nstock price is going up, whereas a put has more value if the stock price is going down.\\n Here's one way to remember the difference: You call up your friend to put down your enemy.\\nFor example, a MSFT 2013 Aug 26.00 call gives you the right to buy Microsoft at $26.00 per share at\\nthe expiration date on the third Friday in August 2013. (Did you know that traders refer to Microsoft as\\n“Mr. Softy”? Clever, huh?) If Microsoft is trading above $26.00, you can exercise the option and make\\na quick profit. If it is selling below $26.00, you could by the stock cheaper in the open market, so the\\noption would be worthless.\\nYou can find great information on options, including online tutorials, at the Chicago Board Options\\nExchange website, www.cboe.com.\\nFutures\\nA futures contract gives you the obligation to buy a set quantity of the underlying asset at a set price and\\na set future date. Futures started in the agricultural industry because they allowed farmers and food\\nprocessors to lock in their prices early in the growing season, reducing the amount of uncertainty in\\ntheir businesses. Futures have now been applied to many different assets, ranging from pork bellies\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 56}),\n",

A simple example is a lock\\nin a home mortgage rate; the borrower knows the rate that will be applied before the sale is closed and\\nthe loan is finalized. Day traders use futures to trade commodities without having to handle the actual\\nassets.\\nMost futures contracts are closed out with cash before the settlement date. Financial contracts — futures\\non currencies, interest rates, or market index values — can only be closed out with cash. Commodity\\ncontracts may be settled with the physical items, but almost all are settled with cash. No one hauls a side\\nof beef onto the floor of the Chicago Board of Trade!\\nWarrants\\nA warrant is similar to an option, but it's issued by the company rather than sold on an organized\\nexchange. (After they are issued, warrants trade similarly to stocks.) A warrant gives the holder the right\\nto buy more stock in the company at an agreed-upon price in the future.\\nA cousin of the warrant is the convertible bond, which is debt issued by the company. The company\\npays interest on the bond, and the bondholder has the right to exchange it for stock, depending on where\\ninterest rates and the stock price are. Convertibles trade on the stock exchanges.\\nBuying and selling derivatives\\nDerivatives trade a little differently than other types of securities because they are based on promises.\\nWhen someone buys an option on a stock, they aren't trading the stock with someone right now; they're\\nbuying the right to buy or sell it in the future. That means that the option buyer needs to know that the\\nperson on the other side is going to pay up. Because of that, the derivatives exchanges have systems in\\nplace to make sure that those who buy and sell the contracts will be able to perform when they have to.\\nRequirements for trading derivatives are different than in other markets.\\nHow derivatives trade\\nI talk about marginability earlier in this chapter, but the word margin is used differently when discussing\\nderivatives, in part because derivatives are already leveraged. You aren't buying the asset, just exposure\\nto the price change, so you can get a lot of bang for your buck. (The risks and rewards of leverage are\\ncovered in detail in Chapter 9.)\\nMargin in the derivatives market is the money you have to put up to ensure that you'll perform on the\\ncontract when it comes time to execute it. In the stock market, margin is collateral against a loan from\\nthe brokerage firm. In the derivatives markets, margin is collateral against the amount you may have to\\npay up on the contract. The more likely it is that you will have to pay the party who bought or sold the\\ncontract, the more margin money you have to put up. Some exchanges prefer to use the term\\nperformance bond instead of margin.\\nTo buy a derivative, you put up the margin with the exchange's clearing house. That way, the exchange\\nknows that you have the money to make good on your side of the deal — if, say, a call option that you\\nsell is executed or you lose money on a currency forward that you buy. Your brokerage firm arranges for\\nthe deposit.\\nAt the end of each day, derivatives contracts are marked-to-market, meaning that they are revalued.\\nProfits are credited to the trader's margin account, and losses are deducted. If the margin falls below the\\nnecessary amount, the trader gets a call and has to deposit more money.\\nBy definition, day traders close out at the end of every day, so their options are not marked-to-market.\\nThe contracts are someone else's problem, and the profits or losses on the trade go straight to the margin\\naccount, ready for the next day's trading.\\nWhere derivatives trade\\nIn the olden days, derivative trading involved open outcry on physical exchanges.

As\\nelectronic trading has become more popular, it has chased many experienced floor traders into\\nretirement because they can't all make the transition, and it has caused much restructuring and\\nconsolidation among the exchanges.\\nChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)\\nThe Chicago Board Options Exchange, often known by the acronym CBOE (pronounced see-bo), is the\\nlargest options market in the United States. This is where orders for stock options are traded. Brokerage\\nfirms use floor brokers in the trading pits or the CBOE's electronic trading system to handle customer\\norders.

The three exchanges merged in 2008, although people often refer to each by its former\\nname. Historically, the Board of Trade specialized in such agricultural commodities as corn, wheat, rice,\\noats, and soybeans, while the Merc offered contracts in non-grain agricultural products (like milk,\\nbutter, cattle, pork bellies, and fertilizer) and in foreign exchange, interest rates, and Standard & Poor's\\nand NASDAQ indexes. Fuels and metals traded at the New York Mercantile Exchange.\\nThe combined CME Group offers a suite of products, known as their E-mini contracts, for smaller\\ntraders. These products allow day traders to play in different agricultural and financial markets without\\nas much margin as would be required for full-sized CME contracts. The E-minis are all traded\\nelectronically, too. Currently, E-minis are available on wheat, corn, and soybeans, as well as on stock\\nmarket indexes in the United States and overseas.\\nIntercontinental Exchange (ICE)\\nThe Intercontinental Exchange (www.theice.com) is a relatively new company that has acquired\\ncommodity and futures exchanges in North America and Europe. In 2008, it acquired the New York\\nBoard of Trade, which offers a range of agricultural and financial contracts, especially on coffee, cotton,\\nand currency exchange rates. Orders are filled in the trading pits or through an electronic trading\\nsystem. Although the ICE doesn't have contracts designed specifically for smaller traders, many day\\ntraders who like commodities and who have enough capital to manage the margin trade there.\\nInternational Securities Exchange (ISE)\\nThe International Securities Exchange (www.ise.com) is the U.S. subsidiary of Eurex, a German\\nderivatives trading firm. It handles trades in equity and foreign-exchange options, including a series of\\nmini options for small traders.

But the lines between the\\nthree can be thin. By knowing where the lines are, you'll be in a better position to follow your trading\\nstrategy and make more money. And if you can avoid the trap of gambling, you'll be better able to\\npreserve your trading capital.\\nThe difference between investing and gambling is the risk and return tradeoff. In investing, the odds are\\ngenerally in your favor, but that doesn't mean you're going to make money. In gambling, the odds are\\nagainst you. And unlike in the finer establishments in Las Vegas, if you end up gambling as a day trader,\\nno one is going to bring you free drinks or tickets to some extravagant show to help ease the pain of\\nfailing. A lot comes down to personality; if you're on a casino's “do not admit” list, you probably aren't\\na great candidate for day trading.\\nDay trading is starting to look more like gambling than it has in years past, because high-frequency\\ntraders are taking more of the arbitrage and scalping opportunities. Be sure you're comfortable with the\\nrisk before you start to trade.\\nThis chapter starts off with a lot of gory details about risk and return. My goal is to help you understand\\nhow the securities markets price risk and reward those who are willing to take it. Then I explain the\\ndifferences in risk and reward for investors, traders, and gamblers to give you better information to help\\nyou plan your day trading.\\nUnderstanding Risk and Return\\nInvestors, traders, and gamblers have this in common: They put their money at risk, and they expect to\\nget a return. Ideally, that return comes in the form of cold, hard cash, but if they're not careful, they\\ncould get nothing — or worse, end up owing money. Traders should risk no more than they can afford\\nto lose.\\n Trading is a business: The more you know about the potential risks and the sources of your\\npotential return, the better off you'll be. Your risk is that you won't get the return you expect, and\\nyour reward is that you get fair compensation for the risk you take.\\nWhat is risk, anyway?\\nRisk is the measurable likelihood of loss. The riskier something is, the more frequently a loss will occur,\\nand the larger that loss is likely to be.

It just means that with the low-risk game, losses are less likely to happen, and when\\nthey do, they're likely to be small.\\n What's the difference between risk and uncertainty? Risk involves the known likelihood of\\nsomething good or bad happening so that it can be priced. What's the likelihood of your living to\\nbe 100? Or of getting into a car accident tonight? Your insurance company knows, and it figures\\nyour rates accordingly. What's the likelihood of aliens from outer space arriving and taking over\\nthe Earth? Who knows! It could happen, but that event is uncertain, not risky — at least until it\\nhappens.\\nThe ability to measure risk makes modern business possible. Until mathematicians were able to use\\nstatistics to quantify human activities, people assumed that bad things were simply the result of bad luck\\nor the wrath of the gods. But when people understand probability, they can apply and use that to assess\\nthe likelihood of an event happening and determine the commensurate compensation for taking the risk.\\nIf a sailor agreed to join a voyage of exploration, what was the probability that he would return home\\nalive? And what would be fair compensation to him for that risk? What was the probability of a silo of\\ngrain going up in flames? And how much should the farmer charge the grain buyers for the risk that he\\nwas taking, and how much should someone else charge to insure the farmer against that fire?\\nConsidering the probability of a loss\\nWhenever you take risk, you take on the probability of loss. If you know what that probability is, you\\ncan determine whether the terms you're being offered are fair and whether you have a reasonable\\nexpectation for the size of the loss.\\nSay that you're presented with this opportunity: You put up $10. You have an 80 percent chance of\\ngetting back $11 and a 20 percent chance of losing everything. Should you take it? To find out, you\\nmultiply the expected return by the likelihood and add them together: (80% × $11) + (20% × $0) =\\n$8.80. Your expected return of $8.80 is less than the $10 cost of this contract, so you should pass on it.\\nNow suppose you're offered this opportunity: You put up $10. You have a 90 percent chance of getting\\nback $11 and a 10 percent chance of getting back $6. Your expected return is (90% × $11) + (10% × $6)\\n= $10.50. This contract would be in your favor, so you should take it.\\nHere's a third proposition: You put up $10. You have a 90 percent chance of getting back $13.89 and a\\n10 percent chance of losing $20 — even more than you put up. Your expected return is (90% × 13.89) +\\n(10% × –$20) = $10.50. You end up with the same expected return as the preceding proposition, but do\\nyou like it as much? Many people would not like that deal because they are looking at the dollar value\\nof the loss rather than the risk. People who overreact to the risk of loss without considering the facts on\\nhand are probably not going to be good traders.\\n When thinking about loss, most people tend to put too much weight on the absolute dollar\\namount that they can lose, rather than thinking about the likelihood of losing it. The problem is\\nthat the markets don't trade on your personal preferences. This is one of the psychological hurdles\\nof trading that those who are successful can overcome. Can you?

That is, you cannot lose any more money than\\nyou invested in the first place. If you buy a stock, that stock can go down to zero, but it can't go any\\nlower.

If you sell a stock short\\n(borrow shares and then sell them in hopes that the stock goes down in price, allowing you to\\nrepay the loan with cheaper shares, a strategy discussed in Chapter 9), and if the stock goes up\\ndrastically, you have to repay the loan with those highly valued shares! Most likely, you're going\\nto close out your position before that happens, but even if you close out your positions every night\\nlike a good day trader should, some strategies have the potential to cost you more money than you\\nhave in your trading account.\\n To protect themselves and to protect you against losing more money than you have, brokerage\\nfirms and options exchanges require you to keep enough funds in your account to cover shortfalls\\n(known as margin, discussed in Chapter 3). You have to be approved before you can trade in\\ncertain securities. For example, anyone trading options has to fill out an agreement that the\\nbrokerage firm must first approve and then keep on file.\\nPlaying the zero-sum game\\nMany day trading strategies are zero-sum games, meaning that for every winner on a trade, there is a\\nloser. It's especially true in options markets. Of course, the person on the other side of the trade may not\\nmind being a loser; she may have entered into a trade to hedge (protect against a decline in) another\\ninvestment and is happy to have a small loss instead of a much larger one.\\nThe problem for you as a day trader is that a zero-sum game has little wiggle room. Every trade you\\nmake is going to win or lose, and your losses may exactly offset your winners. Beating the odds is even\\ntougher when so many traders are using computer algorithms. Backtesting and tracking (see Chapter 16)\\nare important for assessing your changing risk.\\nFinding the probability of not getting the return you expect\\nIn addition to absolute measures of risk and liability, you also need to consider volatility. That's how\\nmuch a security's price may go up or down in a given time period.\\nThe math for measuring volatility is based on standard deviation (discussed in Chapters 3 and 16). A\\nstandard deviation calculation starts with the average return over a given time period. That average is\\nthe expected return — the return that, on average, you'll get if you stick with your trading strategy. But\\nany given week, month, or year, the return may be very different from what you expect. The more likely\\nyou are to get what you expect, the less risk you take in the form of volatility.\\n Standard deviation shows up many times in trading, and you can find a detailed explanation of\\nit in Chapter 16. The key thing to know is this: The higher the standard deviation of the underlying\\nsecurities, the more risk you take with your trade. However, the same volatility creates trading\\nopportunities for day traders to exploit. A security with a low standard deviation isn't going to\\noffer you many chances to make money over the course of a day.\\nStandard deviation is used to calculate another statistic: beta. Beta tells you how risky a security is\\nrelative to the risk of the market itself.

Under the capital assets pricing model, no other sources of risk\\nand return exist. Any other sources would be called alpha, but in theory, alpha doesn't exist. Not\\neveryone agrees with that, but the terms alpha and beta have stuck.\\nGetting rewarded for the risk you take\\nWhen you take risk, you expect to get a return. That's fair enough, right? That return comes in a few\\ndifferent forms related to the risk taken. Although you may not really care how you get your return as\\nlong as you get it, thinking about the breakdown of returns can help you think about your trading\\nstrategy and how it works for you.\\nOpportunity cost\\nThe opportunity cost of your money is the return you could get doing something else. Is your choice day\\ntrading or staying at your current job? Your opportunity cost is your current salary and benefits. You'd\\ngive up that money if you quit to day trade. Is the opportunity cost low enough that it's worth your\\nwhile? It may be. Just because taking advantage of an opportunity carries a cost doesn't mean that the\\nopportunity isn't worth it.\\n When you trade, you want to cover your opportunity cost. Your cost will be different than\\nsomeone else's, but if you know what that cost is up front, you'll have a better idea of whether\\nyour return is worth your risk.\\nHere's another way to think about opportunity cost. When you make one trade, you give up the\\nopportunity to use that money for another trade. That means you only want to trade if you know that the\\ntrade is going to work out, more likely than not. That's why you need to plan your trades (see Chapter 2)\\nand backtest (run a simulation using your strategy and historic securities prices) and evaluate your\\nperformance (see Chapter 16). By doing these things, you know that you are trading for the right\\nreasons and not just out of boredom.\\nRisk-free rate of return and the time value of money\\nThe value of money changes over time. In most cases, this change is the result of inflation, which is the\\ngeneral increase in price levels in an economy. But the value of money also changes because you give\\nup the use of money for some period of time. That's why any investment or trading opportunity should\\ninclude compensation for the time value of your money.\\nIn day trading, your returns from the time value of money are small, because you only hold positions for\\na short period of time and close them out overnight. Still, there's some time component to the money\\nyou make. That smallest return is known as the risk-free rate of return. That's what you demand for\\ngiving up the use of your money, even if you know with certainty that you'll get your money back. In\\npractice, investors think of the risk-free rate of return as the rate on U.S. government treasury bills,\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 62}),\n",

It's all about work and risk.\\nThis concept is known as the risk-reward tradeoff. The greater the potential reward, the greater the\\namount of risk you're expected to take and thus the greater potential you have for loss. But if you\\nunderstand the risks you're taking, you may well find that they're worth it. That's why you have to think\\nabout the risks and rewards up front.\\nMarket efficiency in the real world\\nThe reason a balance exists between risk and reward is that markets are reasonably efficient. This\\nefficiency means that prices reflect all known information about the companies and the economy and\\nthat all participants understand the relative tradeoffs available to them. Otherwise, you'd have\\nopportunities to make a riskless profit, and that just won't do, according to the average economist. “You\\ncan't pluck nickels out of thin air,” they like to say. In an efficient market, if an opportunity exists to\\nmake money without risk, someone would have taken advantage of it already.\\nHere's how market efficiency works: You have information that says that Company A is going to\\nannounce good earnings tomorrow, so you buy the stock. Your increased demand causes the price to go\\nup, and pretty soon, the stock price is where it should be, given that the company is doing well. The\\ninformation advantage is rapidly eliminated. In most cases, everyone gets the news — or hears the\\nrumor — of the good earnings at the same time, so the price adjustment happens quickly.\\n Wouldn't it be great to get the news of a good earnings report before everyone else and make a\\nquick trading profit? Yep. At least until the Feds show up and haul you off to prison — talk about\\nyour opportunity costs. Trading on material inside information (information that is not generally\\nknown that would affect the price of the security) is illegal. And yes, the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission and the exchanges monitor trading to see whether trading patterns suggest illegal\\ntrading based on inside information because they want all investors and traders to feel confident\\nthat the investment business is fair. Be very wary of tips that seem too good to be true.\\nThe markets may be more or less efficient, but that doesn't mean they work by magic. Price changes\\nhappen because people act on news, and the people who act the fastest are day traders. In the example,\\nnotice that it was the activity of traders that caused the price of Company A stock to go up to reflect the\\nexpected good earnings report.\\nIn economic terms, arbitrage is a riskless profit. A hard-core believer in academic theory would say that\\narbitrage opportunities don't exist. In practice, though, they do. Here's how arbitrage works: Although\\nCompany A is expected to have a good earnings announcement tomorrow, you notice that the stock\\nprice has gone up faster than the price of a call option on Company A, even though premium should\\nreflect the stock price. So you sell Company A (borrowing shares and selling it short if you have to) and\\nthen use the proceeds to buy the option. When the option price goes up to reflect the stock price, you\\ncan sell the option (that is, close out your short position) and lock in a riskless profit — at least, before\\nyour trading costs are considered.

Don't count on crazy price action\\nevery day.\\nThe oldest economics joke ever told\\nAfter you become wise to the ways of risk and return, this joke should make sense to you:\\nTwo economists are walking down the street. One sees a $20 bill on the sidewalk and stops to pick it up.\\n“Don't bother,” says the other. “If it were real, someone would have taken it already.”\\n“Don't be so sure,” says the first economist. He picks it up, sees that it is real, then turns to his friend and\\nsays, “How about if I buy you a free lunch?”\\nDifferentiating T rading, Investing, and\\nGambling\\nDay trading is a cousin to both investing and gambling, but it is not the same as either. Day trading\\ninvolves quick reactions to the markets, not a long-term consideration of all the factors that can drive an\\ninvestment. It works with odds in your favor, or at least that are even, rather than with odds that are\\nagainst you.\\nStill, the three activities overlap. Many day traders also invest, and some came to trading after years of\\nwatching the markets as an investor. In addition, more than one day trader claims that good poker skills\\nare useful for understanding market psychology, and many day traders can point to a winning trade that\\nwas made for no particular reason at all. To help you keep straight the differences between day trading,\\ninvesting, and gambling, this section explains which is which so that you can better understand what\\nyou're doing when you day trade. After all, you can increase your chances of success if you stick to the\\nbusiness at hand.\\nInvesting is slow and steady\\nInvesting is the process of putting money at risk in order to get a return. It's the raw material of\\ncapitalism. It's the way that businesses get started, roads get built, and explorations get financed. It's\\nhow our economy matches people who have more money than they need, at least during part of their\\nlives, with people who need it in order to grow society's capabilities.\\nInvesting is heady stuff. And it's very much focused on the long term. Good investors do a lot of\\nresearch before committing their money because they know that it will take a long time to see a payoff.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 64}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"65That's okay with them. Investors often invest in things that are out of favor, because they know that,\\nwith time, others will recognize the value and respond in kind.\\nOne of the best investors of all time is Warren Buffett, chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway.\\nHis annual letters to shareholders offer great insight. You can read them at\\nwww.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html.\\nWhat's the difference between investing and saving? When you save, you take no risk. Your\\ncompensation is low; it's just enough to cover the time value of money. Generally, the return on savings\\nequals inflation and no more. In fact, a lot of banks pay a lot less than the inflation rate on a federally\\ninsured savings account, meaning that you're paying the bank to use your money.\\nIn contrast to investing, day trading moves fast. Day traders react only to what's on the screen. There's\\nno time to do research, and the market is always right when you're day trading. You don't have two\\nmonths or two years to wait for the fundamentals to work out and the rest of Wall Street to see how\\nsmart you were. You have today. And if you can't live with that, you shouldn't be day trading.\\nTrading works fast\\nTrading is the act of buying and selling securities. All investors trade, because they need to buy and sell\\ntheir investments. But to investors, trading is a rare transaction, and they get more value from finding a\\ngood opportunity, buying it cheap, and selling it at a much higher price sometime in the future. But\\ntraders are not investors.\\nTraders look to take advantage of short-term price discrepancies in the market. In general, they don't\\ntake a lot of risk on each trade, so they don't get a lot of return on each trade, either. Traders act quickly.\\nThey look at what the market is telling them and then respond. They know that many of their trades\\nwon't work out, but as long as more than half work, they'll be okay. They don't do a lot of in-depth\\nresearch on the securities they trade, but they know the normal price and volume patterns well enough\\nthat they can recognize potential profit opportunities.\\nTrading keeps markets efficient because it creates the short-term supply and demand that eliminates\\nsmall price discrepancies. It also creates a lot of stress for traders, who must react in the here and now.\\nTraders give up the luxury of time in exchange for a quick profit.\\n Speculation is related to trading in that it often involves short-term transactions. Speculators\\ntake risks, assuming a much greater return than may be expected, and a lot of what-ifs may have\\nto be satisfied for the transaction to pay off. Many speculators hedge their risks with other\\nsecurities, such as options or futures.\\nGambling is nothing more than luck\\nA gambler puts up money in the hopes of a payoff if a random event occurs. The odds are always\\nagainst the gambler and in favor of the house, but people like to gamble because they like to hope that,\\nif they hit it lucky, their return will be as large as their loss is likely.\\nSome gamblers believe that the odds can be beaten, but they are wrong. (Certain card games are more\\ngames of skill than gambling, assuming you can find a casino that plays under standard rules. Yeah, you\\ncan count cards when playing blackjack with your friends, but doing so is a lot harder in a\\nprofessionally run casino.) They get excited about the potential for a big win and get caught up in the\\nglamour of the casino, and soon the odds go to work and drain away their stakes.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n",

You won't find it at most casinos, although sometimes the odds in a\\nsports book or horse race favor the bettor, at least in the short term. A more common example\\ntakes place in lotteries when the jackpots roll over to astronomical amounts. For example, in May\\n2013, the multi-state Powerball lottery had a jackpot of $590 million, but the odds of winning\\nwere 1 in 175 million. This means that a $1.00 ticket had an expected value of $3.37, making it a\\nfair proposition. (That $590 million was a record that has not been beaten.)\\n Trading is not gambling, but traders who are not paying attention to their strategy and its\\nperformance can cross over into gambling. They can view the blips on their computer screen as a\\ngame. They can start making trades without any regard for the risk and return characteristics. They\\ncan start believing that how they do things affects the trade. And pretty soon, they are using the\\nsecurities market as a giant casino, using trading techniques that have odds as bad as any slot\\nmachine.\\nManaging the Risks of Day T rading\\nWhen you know more about the risks, returns, and related activities of day trading, you can think more\\nabout how you're going to run your day-trading business. Before you flip through the book to find out\\nhow to get started, consider two more kinds of risk that you need to think about:\\nBusiness risk\\nPersonal risk\\nYou need to understand and manage both in order to better manage the risks of the trading day.\\nIt's your business\\nBusiness risk is the uncertainty of the timing of your cash flow. Not every month of trading is going to\\nbe great, but your bills will come due no matter what. You'll have to pay for subscriptions while keeping\\nthe lights turned on and the computer connected to the Internet. Taxes come due four times a year, and\\nkeyboards hold a mysterious attraction for carbonated beverages, causing them to short out at the most\\ninopportune times.\\nKeep track of your business expenses and keep them as low as is reasonable. You should invest in your\\nbusiness, obviously, but only to the extent that you can pay your bills even if you have an off month in\\nthe market.\\n Regardless of what happens to your trading account, you need cash on hand to pay your bills\\nor you'll be out of business. The best way to protect yourself is to start out with a cash cushion just\\nfor covering your operating expenses. Keep this cushion separate from your trading funds.\\nReplenish it during good months. Walk away from trading if it goes down to zero.\\nIt's your life\\nThe personal risk of trading is that it becomes an obsession that crowds out everything else in your life.\\nTrading is a stressful business, and the difference between those who succeed and those who fail is\\noften psychological.

Every moment of the\\ntrading day, the actions of buyers and sellers determine what the price of a stock, commodity, or\\ncurrency should be at that moment, given the supply, the demand, and the information out there. It's\\nbeautiful.\\nOne reason the markets work well most of the time is that they are regulated. That may seem like an\\noxymoron: Isn't capitalism all about free trade, unfettered by any rules from nannying bureaucrats? Ah,\\nbut for capitalism to work, people on both sides of a trade need to know that the terms will be enforced.\\nThey need to know that the money in their accounts is there and is safe from theft. And they need to\\nknow that no one has an unfair advantage. Regulation creates the trust that makes markets function.\\nAs a day trader, you may not be managing money for other investors, and you may not answer to an\\nemployer, but that doesn't mean you don't have rules to follow. Day traders have to comply with\\napplicable securities laws and exchange regulations, some of which specifically address those who\\nmake lots of short-term trades. Likewise, brokers and advisors who deal with day traders have\\nregulations that they need to follow. Understanding all these different rules and regulations can help you\\nmake better decisions about whom to deal with. In this chapter, you find out who does the regulating,\\nwhat they look at, and how they affect you.\\nLooking Back on the Road to Regulations\\nWith the advent of the telegraph, traders were able to receive daily price quotes. Many cities had bucket\\nshops, storefront businesses where traders bet on changes in stock and commodity prices. These traders\\nweren't buying the security itself, even for a few minutes; instead they were placing bets against others.\\nThese schemes were highly prone to manipulation and fraud, and they were wiped out after the stock\\nmarket crash of 1929.\\nAfter the 1929 crash, small investors began trading off the ticker tape, which was a printout of price\\nchanges sent by telegraph, or wire. In most cases, traders made these transactions by going down to\\ntheir brokerage firm's office, sitting in a conference room, and placing orders based on the changes they\\nsaw come across the tape. Really serious traders got wires installed in their own offices, but the costs\\nwere prohibitive for most individual investors. In any event, traders still had to place their orders\\nthrough a broker. Because they didn't have direct access to the market, they couldn't count on timely\\nexecution.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"69\\n Another reason there was so little day trading back then is that all brokerage firms charged the\\nsame commissions until 1975. That year, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that this\\npractice amounted to price fixing. After this ruling, brokers could compete on their commissions.\\nSome brokerage firms, such as Charles Schwab, began to allow customers to trade stock at\\ndiscount commission rates, which made active trading more profitable. Some brokerage firms\\ndon't even charge commissions anymore (but don't worry; they get money from you in other\\nways).\\nThe system of trading off the ticker tape more or less persisted until the stock market crash of 1987.\\nBrokerage firms and market makers were flooded with orders, so they took care of their biggest\\ncustomers first and pushed the smallest trades to the bottom of the pile. After the crash, the exchanges\\nand the Securities and Exchange Commission called for several changes designed to reduce the chances\\nof another crash and improve execution if one were to happen. One of those changes was the Small\\nOrder Entry System, often known as SOES, which gave orders of 1,000 shares or less priority over\\nlarger orders.\\nThen, in the 1990s, Internet access became widely available, and several electronic communications\\nnetworks started giving small traders direct access to price quotes and trading activities. This meant that\\ntraders could place orders on the same footing as the brokers they once had to work through. In fact,\\nthanks to the SOES, the small traders had an advantage: They could place orders and then sell the stock\\nto the larger firms, locking in a nice profit. Day trading looked like a pretty good way to make a living.\\nSOES coincided with the rise of the commercial Internet, making the late 1990s a golden era for day\\ntraders, at least in the popular imagination. More and more discount brokerage firms offered Internet\\ntrading while Internet stocks became wildly popular. No one needed SOES to make profits when\\nPets.com and Webvan were going up in price day after day, at least for a while. (Remember that? No?\\nWell, it was fun while it lasted.)\\nThen market for tech stocks cratered in 2000, in part because so many of the companies cratered, too.\\nFor much of the next decade, the markets were mostly quiet while new products were introduced that\\nappealed to day traders, including exchange-traded funds and miniature commodities contracts (both of\\nwhich are discussed in Chapter 3).\\nAnd then things got crazy. In 2008, brokerage firms failed, and the financial markets came darn near\\nclose to collapse. All that volatility was a lot of fun for those traders who could handle it. The brokerage\\nfirms developed larger and more sophisticated trading programs that seemed to work well until a single\\nlarge order on the afternoon of May 6, 2010, caused everything to go haywire. That so-called “flash\\ncrash” exposed the risks created by high-frequency trading programs; at first, no one wanted to blame\\ntechnology and instead tried to place the blame on traders whose fingers were too big to punch the\\nnumbers on their order-entry machines.\\nThe financial system received generous government bailouts in the fall of 2008 in the hopes of staving\\noff another depression. The exchanges and the federal government created new regulations in the major\\ninstitutions, although little has changed for day traders — at least so far.\\nSo what are the regulations that affect day traders? Well, keep reading!\\nReviewing the Regulators\\nIn the United States, financial markets receive general regulatory oversight from two government\\nbodies: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading\\nCommission (CFTC).

It's not straightforward, but the overlap between these organizations seems to\\nensure that problems are identified early on and that the interests of companies, brokers, and investment\\nmanagers are fairly represented.\\nStock and corporate bond market regulation\\nThe stock and corporate bond markets are the most prominent. Regulators are active and visible because\\nthese markets have a relatively large number of relatively small issuers. In the currency market, by\\ncontrast, the only issuers are governments, and there are a lot fewer of them than there are public\\ncompanies.

If any complaints have been filed, you can see what they are and decide for yourself how\\nyou feel about them. This great information can help you head off problems with sales people or\\nbrokerage firms early on. BrokerCheck has helped me a time or two when I've been looking into\\npotential business partners.\\n FINRA's predecessor, the National Association of Securities Dealers, started as a self-\\nregulatory organization, but in the late 1960s, it saw that member firms needed a better way to\\ntrade over-the-counter securities (securities that don't trade on an organized exchange like the New\\nYork Stock Exchange). In 1971, it formed its own electronic communication network, the\\nNational Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system, or NASDAQ,\\npronounced as one word: NAZ-dack. In 2000, the NASD divested NASDAQ, which is now\\nknown only by that name, and returned to its self-regulatory organization roots. Although the two\\nare now separate, brokerage firms that trade securities on NASDAQ must be members of FINRA.\\nThe exchanges\\nAlthough the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ got out of the brokerage oversight business\\nwhen they formed FINRA, they are both involved in regulation. In particular, these and the smaller\\nexchanges work to ensure that companies with securities traded on the exchange meet the criteria set for\\ntheir listings. These criteria include timely financial reporting with the SEC and minimum numbers of\\nshares that are actually traded. (Chapter 3 has a description of the different exchanges and their listing\\nrequirements.)\\nThe exchanges also monitor how securities are traded in order to look for patterns that may point to\\nmarket manipulation or insider trading. Each exchange works with the brokerage firms that are allowed\\nto trade on its exchange to make sure that the brokers know who their customers are and that the brokers\\nhave systems in place to make certain that their customers play by the rules.\\nThe Federal Reserve System\\nThe Federal Reserve System, known as the Fed to friend and foe alike, is the central bank of the United\\nStates, and one of its roles is to ensure the integrity of the country's financial system. Although most\\nFederal Reserve regulation is aimed at commercial banks, the Fed gets involved in securities markets in\\ntimes of crisis to ensure that the markets continue to function. In the 2008 financial crisis, this\\ninvolvement included arranging the mergers of failing brokerage firms as well as buying troubled assets\\nfrom different banks, brokerage firms, and insurance companies.\\nThe Securities Investor Protection Corporation\\nThe Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) was founded in 1970 to protect brokerage\\naccounts from losses in the event of the firm's bankruptcy.

The organizations may not be household names, but their functions are\\nfamiliar.\\nCommodity Futures T rading Commission (CFTC)\\nThe CFTC (www.cftc.gov) is a government agency founded in 1974 to oversee market activities in\\nagricultural and financial commodities. The government realized that these markets needed some\\nregulation but were sufficiently different from traditional stock exchanges that the SEC might not be the\\nbest agency to handle it.

(Chapter 3\\ndescribes the different exchanges and what they do.)\\nTo look for patterns that may point to market manipulation or insider trading, the exchanges also\\nmonitor how derivatives are traded.

Options and futures on currency are regulated as derivatives, through the CFTC, the NFA, and\\nthe relevant futures exchanges.

That leads to some basic regulations about suitability, pattern day\\ntrading, and money laundering — and extra paperwork for you. Don't get too annoyed by all the\\npaperwork you have to fill out to open an account, because your brokerage firm has to do even more.\\nGauging suitability\\nBrokerage firms and FCMs have to make sure that customer activities are appropriate. The firms need\\nto know their customers and be sure that any recommendations are suitable. When it comes to day\\ntrading, firms need to be sure that customers are dealing with risk capital — money that they can afford\\nto lose. They also need to be sure that the customers understand the risks that they are taking.\\nDepending on the firm and what you're trying to do, you may have to submit financial statements, sign a\\nstack of disclosures, and verify that you have received different guides to trading.\\nYour financial situation is no one's business but your own — except of course that the various regulators\\nwant to make sure that firm employees aren't talking customers into taking risks that they shouldn't be\\ntaking.

If this criminal fellow takes all that cash to the bank, those pesky bankers will\\nstart asking a lot of questions, because they know that most people pursuing legitimate business\\nactivities get paid through checks or electronic direct deposit.\\nHence, the felon with funds looks for a way to make it appear that the money is legitimate.

       " Document(page_content=\"76FINRA has a long list of rules that its member firms have to meet to stay in business. One, still known\\nas NASD Rule 2520 despite the merger of the NASD that created FINRA, deals specifically with day\\ntraders. This rule sets the minimum account size and margin requirements for those who fit the\\ndefinition of day traders, and I'll give you a hint: The requirements are stricter than for other types of\\naccounts to reflect the greater risk, although they give some flexibility on maintenance margin.\\nFINRA defines day trading as the buying or selling of the same security on the same day in a margin\\naccount (that is, using borrowed money). Execute four or more of those day trades within five business\\ndays, and you are a pattern day trader, unless those four or more trades were 6 percent or less of all the\\ntrades you made over those five days.\\n The National Futures Association does not have a definition of day trading, because futures\\ntrades by their very nature are short term.\\nHere's why NASD Rule 2520 matters: If you are a pattern day trader, you can have a margin of 25\\npercent in your account, which means you can borrow 75 percent of the cost of the securities that you're\\ntrading. Most customers are only allowed to borrow 50 percent. The reason for the higher amount?\\nPattern day traders almost always close out their positions overnight, so the firm has less risk of having\\nthe loan outstanding. However, you have to have a margin account if you are a pattern day trader. That\\nis, you have to sign an agreement saying that you understand the risks of borrowing money, including\\nthat you may have to repay more than is in your account and that your broker can sell securities out\\nfrom under you to ensure you pay what is owed.\\nUnder Rule 2520, you have to have at least $25,000 in your brokerage account at the start of the trading\\nday. If you have losses that take your account below that, you have to come up with more money before\\nyour broker allows you to continue day trading. If you don't make the deposits necessary to bring your\\naccount up to at least $25,000 and at least 25 percent of the amount of money you've borrowed within\\nfive business days, you have to trade on a cash basis (no borrowing), assuming the firm will even let\\nyou trade.\\nDon't bother trying to plead your case, because the broker has to comply with the law. Firms pay a price\\nif they let customers slide. In 2010, FINRA fined brokerage firm Scottrade $200,000 for allowing\\ncustomers who met the definition of pattern day traders to trade without maintaining $25,000 in their\\naccounts. The firm sent customers warnings but allowed them to trade in violation of the rule — a\\ndecision that wasn't cool with the regulators.\\n The rules set by FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations are minimum requirements.\\nBrokerage firms are free to set higher limits for account size and borrowing, and many do in order\\nto manage their own risks better.\\nReporting taxes\\nOn top of the identity paperwork, you have forms to fill out for tax reporting. IRS Form W9 keeps your\\ntaxpayer information on record. Then, after the end of the year, the brokerage firm sends you form\\n1099B listing how much money you made in your account, breaking it out between income and capital\\ngains on stocks, bonds, options, and futures. You use that to ensure that the taxman gets his cut. Tax\\nissues are covered in Chapter 15, but for now, just keep in mind that your federal, state, and local taxing\\nauthorities are paying attention to how well your trading does.\\nWatching Out for Insider T rading\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 76}),\n",

If you knew ahead of time about big merger announcements, interest-rate decisions by the\\nFederal Reserve, or a new sugar substitute that would eliminate demand for corn syrup, you could make\\na lot of money in the stock market, trading options on interest-rate futures or playing in the grain futures\\nmarket. In doing so, however, you'd have an unfair advantage. If everyone believed that such unfair\\nadvantages were common, then they would be unwilling to participate in the capital markets, and that\\nwould harm the economy.\\n Insider trading is not well defined. Insider information includes any nonpublic information that\\na reasonable person would consider when deciding whether to buy or sell a security, and that's a\\npretty vague standard — especially because the whole purpose of research is to combine bits of\\nimmaterial information together to make investment decisions.\\nDay traders, who buy and sell so quickly, can be susceptible to hot tips. They may be participating in\\nmessage boards or chat services where hot rumors can get the blood flowing on a dull day.

If you get great information\\nfrom someone who is in a position to know — an officer, a director, a lawyer, an investment banker —\\nand you act on this information in your trades or share it with someone who then acts on it, you may be\\nlooking at stiff penalties. Civil penalties are usually three times your profits, but the government may\\ndecide that your trading was part of a criminal enterprise, making the potential penalties much greater.\\n Insider trading is difficult to prove, so federal regulators use other tools to punish those it\\nsuspects of making improper profits. Martha Stewart wasn't sent to prison on insider trading\\ncharges; she was charged with obstructing justice by lying to investigators about what happened.\\nWhenever a big announcement is made, such as a merger, the exchanges go back and review trading for\\nthe past several days to see whether any unusual activities occurred in relevant securities and\\nderivatives.

(Traders love volatility, but the NYSE isn't so keen.)\\nHere's how circuit breakers work:\\nIf the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 10 percent before 2 p.m. New York time, trading\\nstops for one hour. If it falls that much between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., trading stops for a half hour.\\nIf it falls that much after 2:30 p.m., trading continues until the bell rings at 4 p.m. or until it hits the\\n20 percent mark, at which point it's done for the day.\\nIf the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 20 percent before 1 p.m. New York time, trading\\nstops for two hours. If it falls that much between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m., trading stops for one hour. If it\\nfalls that much after 2 p.m., trading closes for the day.\\nIf the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls by 30 percent, trading ends for the day, although it\\nmost likely would have been shut down already due to the 20 percent rule.\\nThe other exchanges don't have to follow the New York Stock Exchange rules, but they often do. In\\naddition, the NYSE has the right to halt trading in any one security if it falls by more than 10 percent in\\na five-minute period.\\nShort-selling restrictions can be put into place if the regulatory authorities believe that action in one\\nindustry is dragging down the entire market. In the fall of 2008, short-selling was temporarily banned\\non financial services stocks.\\nFinally, if the market really goes haywire, the exchanges have the right to break trades, cancelling the\\nbuy and sell orders that looked too good to be true. When the Flash Crash of 2010 hit, many traders\\nwere thrilled to find that they could buy shares in illustrious and profitable corporations for a fraction of\\ntheir usual share price. They weren't so thrilled when the exchanges cancelled those trades.\\n The Securities and Exchange Commission allows stock exchanges to break trades whenever\\nprices in the system are “clearly erroneous,” especially if a computer malfunction is involved.\\nSome traders allege that trades are broken even if the prices are not clearly erroneous, denying\\nthem a sure-thing profit. The guidelines allow exchanges to consider breaking a trade whenever\\nprices vary by 10 percent for stocks priced under $25, 5 percent for stocks priced between $25 and\\n$50, and 3 percent of stocks priced over $50. Also, the review process should begin within 30\\nminutes of the trade.\\nIf you see a fabulous bargain, go ahead and make the trade, but know that it may be cancelled if that\\ngreat price was due to an error.\\nTaking on Partners\\nAfter your day trading proves to be wildly successful, you may want to take on partners to give you\\nmore trading capital and a slightly more regular income from the management fees. You can take on\\npartners, but it's a lot of work, and once again, you must follow certain rules and procedures.\\nIf you're trading options and futures and are operating a commodity pool or working as a commodity\\ntrading advisor, you need to register with the National Futures Association.

Sure, risking\\neverything on one idea may work a few times, but are you that lucky? If you're smart about your money\\nmanagement, you don't need luck.\\nFinding your expected return\\nBefore you can figure out how to manage your money, you need to figure out how much money you can\\nexpect to make. This amount is your expected return, although some traders prefer the word expectancy.\\nYou start by laying out your trading system and testing it (described in Chapter 16). You're looking for\\nfour numbers:\\nHow many of your trades are losers?\\nWhat's the typical percentage loss on a losing trade?\\nHow many of your trades are winners?\\nWhat's the typical percentage gain on a winning trade?\\nSay that you determine that a certain trade loses 40 percent of the time, and it loses 1 percent. Sixty\\npercent of the time, the trade wins, and winning trades are up 1.5 percent. With these numbers, you can\\ncalculate your per-trade expected return, like this:\\n% of losing trades × loss on losing trades + % of winning trades × gain on winning trades =\\nexpected return\\nWhich in this example works out to be\\n0.40 × –0.01 + 0.60 × 0.015 = –0.004 + 0.009 = 0.005, which is the same as 0.5%.\\nOn average, then, you would expect to earn 0.5 percent on every trade you make. Make enough trades\\nwith enough money, and it adds up.\\n You are more likely to make more money if you have a high expectation of winning trades and\\nif those winners are expected to perform well. As long as probability of loss exists, you stand to\\nlose money.\\nDetermining your probability of ruin\\nExpected return is the happy number. It's how much money you can expect to make if you stay in the\\ntrading game. But it has a counterpart that, while not so happy, is at least as important: the probability of\\nruin.\\nYes, ruin.\\nAs long as some probability of loss exists, no matter how small, there is some probability that you can\\nlose everything when you're trading. How much you can lose depends on how large each trade is\\nrelative to your account, the likelihood of each trade having a loss, and the size of the losses as they\\noccur. (Don't think it can happen? That's what the top executives at AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman\\nBrothers, and Washington Mutual said.)\\nMany traders who have winning trading strategies find themselves shut down because a few bad trades\\nruined them.

The equation you use to calculate the probability of ruin\\n(R) is\\nIn this equation, A is the advantage on each trade. That's the difference between the percentage of\\nwinning trades and the percentage of losing trades. In the expected return example discussed earlier,\\ntrades win 60 percent of the time and lose everything 40 percent of the time. In that case, the trader's\\nadvantage would be\\n60% – 40% = 20%\\nAnd c is the number of trades in an account. Assume that you're dividing the account into ten equal\\nparts, with the plan of making ten trades today. The probability of ruin today is 1.7 percent, as shown in\\nthis equation:\\nNow 1.7 percent isn't a high likelihood of ruin, but it's not zero, either. It can happen. If your advantage\\nis smaller, if the expected loss is larger, or if the number of trades is fewer, then the likelihood becomes\\neven higher.\\nFigure 6-1 shows you the relationship between the trader's advantage, number of trades, and the\\ncorresponding probability of ruin, rounded to the nearest percentage.\\nFigure 6-1:  Adding trader's advantage to the mix.\\nThe bigger the edge and the more trades you can make, the lower your probability of ruin. Now, this\\nmodel is a simplification in that it assumes that a losing trade goes to zero, and that's not always the\\ncase. In fact, if you use stops (automatic buy and sell orders, described in Chapter 2), you should never\\nhave a 100 percent loss. But you can see steady erosion in your account that will make it harder for you\\nto make money. Hence, probability of ruin is a useful calculation that shows whether you'll lose money\\nin the long run.\\n The more trades you can make with your account, the lower your probability of ruin.

But as long as there's a chance of making money, you want to have enough exposure to a winning\\ntrade so that you can post good profits. How do you figure out how much money to risk?\\nLater in this chapter, I describe some of the different money-management systems that traders use to\\nfigure out how much money to risk per trade. But first, I want to explain the logic behind a money-\\nmanagement system so that you understand why you need one. That way, you can better manage your\\nfunds and improve the dollar returns to your trading.\\nMinimizing damage while increasing opportunity\\nExpected return gives you an idea of how much you can get from a trade on average, but it doesn't tell\\nyou how much that return may vary from trade to trade. The average of 9, 10, and 11 is 10; the average\\nof –90, 10, and 110 is also 10. The first number series is a lot narrower than the second. The wider the\\nrange of returns that a strategy has, the more volatile it is.\\nMeasuring volatility\\nYou can measure volatility in several ways. One common measurement is standard deviation, which tells\\nyou how much your actual return is likely to differ from what you expect to get. The higher the standard\\ndeviation, the more volatile, and riskier, the strategy.\\nIn the derivatives markets, volatility is measured by a group of numbers known as the Greeks: delta,\\ngamma, vega, and theta. These numbers are based on calculus, but don't worry if you forgot it or never\\ntook it!\\nDelta is a ratio that tells you how much the option or future changes in price when the underlying\\nsecurity or market index  changes  in price. Delta changes over time.\\nGamma is the rate of change on delta. A derivative's delta will be higher when it is close to the\\nexpiration date, for example, than when the expiration date is further away.\\nVega is the amount that the derivative would change in price if the implied volatility of the\\nunder lying security shifted by 1 percent.\\nTheta is the amount that a derivative's price declines as it gets closer to the day of expiration.\\nDay traders seek more volatile securities because they offer more opportunities to make money during\\nany given day. For this reason, they need to have ways to minimize the damage that may occur while\\nbeing able to capitalize on the upward swings. Money management can help with that.\\nStaying in the market longer\\nYou have only a limited amount of money to trade. Whether it's $1,000 or $1,000,000, once the money's\\ngone, you're out. The problem is that you can have a long string of losing trades before the markets go\\nin a direction that favors you and your system.\\nSay you trade 100 percent of your account. If you have one trade that goes down 100 percent, then you\\nhave nothing. If you divide your account into ten parts, then you can have ten total losers before you're\\nout. If you start with ten equal parts and double each time you lose, you can be out after four losing\\ntrades.\\nOn the other hand, if you divide your account into 100 portions, then you can endure 100 losing trades.\\nIf you trade fractions of your account, then you can keep going indefinitely, or at least until you get\\ndown to a level that's too low to place a minimum order.

Money management can keep you in the game longer, and that\\ngives you more opportunities to place winning trades.\\n The riskier your trading strategy, the more thought you need to put into money management.\\nOtherwise, you can find yourself out of the market in no time.\\nGetting out before you lose everything\\nA money-management system works best if the trader using it knows when to close out a position. You\\nhave to have a trading plan and know when you're willing to get out: at the recent high? A few ticks\\nbelow the most recent high? A few ticks up from where you entered? A few ticks below where you\\nentered, to limit your losses?\\nSometimes the market will go nuts, and you won't be able to get out as quickly as you'd like. In these\\nsituations, those tiny chances of losing everything kick in, and good money management offers the most\\nprotection.\\nOn more ordinary trading days, be sure to supplement your position size and capital protection efforts\\nwith ordinary trading tools: trade planning and use of stop and limit orders. You can review these in\\nChapter 2.\\nAccounting for opportunity costs\\nOpportunity cost is the value you give up because you choose to do something else. In trading, each\\ndollar you commit to one trade is a dollar that you cannot commit to another trade. Thus, each dollar\\nyou trade carries some opportunity cost, and good traders seek to minimize this cost. During the course\\nof the trading day, you may see several great trades, and some opportunities will show up before you are\\nready to close out a different trade.\\nBecause a money-management system holds back some of your capital, you are more likely to have\\nfunds to take advantage of these opportunities than if you allocate your cash willy-nilly. Your plan may\\ncause you to miss some trades, and that's okay. If you believe that you are missing too many, though,\\nyou may want to experiment with another system to see whether it gives you better results. Whatever\\nyou do, don't ignore money management.\\n If you have committed all your capital to one trade, you miss out on the second. That alone is a\\ngood reason to keep some money on the table each time you trade.\\nExamining Styles of Money Management\\nOver the years, traders have developed many different ways to manage their money. Some money-\\nmanagement strategies are rooted in superstition, but most are based on different statistical probability\\ntheories. The underlying idea is that you should never place all of your money in a single trade. Instead,\\nyou should put in an amount appropriate given the level of volatility. Otherwise, you risk losing\\neverything too soon.\\n Calculating position size under many of these formulas is tricky stuff.

And\\nif that's your situation, you have one big money-management decision to make before you begin: how\\nmuch money to allocate to each market!\\nLimiting portions: Fixed fractional\\nFixed-fractional trading assumes that you want to limit each trade to a set portion of your total account,\\noften between 2 and 10 percent. Within that range, you trade a larger percentage of money in less risky\\ntrades and a smaller amount of money for more risky trades. (In other words, this method isn't all that\\n“fixed,” but no one asked me to pick a name for the system!)\\nHere's the fixed fractional equation for calculating fixed-fractional trade proportions.\\nN is the number of contracts or shares of stock you should trade, f is the fixed fraction of your account\\nthat you have decided to trade, equity is the value of your total account, and trade risk is the amount of\\nmoney you could lose on the transaction. Because trade risk is a negative number, you need to convert it\\nto a positive number to make the equation work. Those vertical bars in the equation (| |) are the sign for\\nabsolute value, and that means that you convert the number between them to a positive number.\\nHere's an example that uses the equation. Assume that you've decided to limit each trade to 10 percent\\nof your account, you have a $20,000 account, and you are looking at contracts with a value of $3,500.\\nYou want to set your trade based on the assumption that the contracts go to zero, to look at the worst-\\ncase scenario. Plugging the numbers into the equation and doing the math gives you\\nOf course, you probably can't trade 0.57 of a contract, so in this case, you would have to round up to\\none.\\nProtecting profits: Fixed ratio\\nDeveloped by a trader named Ryan Jones, the fixed-ratio money-management system is used in trading\\noptions and futures. The idea behind fixed-ratio trading is to help you increase your exposure to the\\nmarket while protecting your accumulated profits.\\nTo find the optimal number of options or futures contracts to trade, you use this equation\\nN is the number of contracts or shares of stock that you should trade, P is your accumulated profit to\\ndate, and Δ (delta) is the dollar amount you would need before you could trade a second contract or\\nanother lot of stock. (Don't confuse this delta with the delta used to measure of volatility; see the sidebar\\n“Measuring volatility” for more information.)\\nFor example, the minimum margin for Chicago Mercantile Exchange E-mini S&P 500 futures contract,\\nwhich gives you exposure to the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, is $3,500. Until you have another\\n$3,500 in your account, you can't trade a second contract. If you use fixed-ratio money management to\\ntrade this future, your delta is $3,500.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

If you plug in the numbers and calculate, you see that you should trade 2.94\\ncontracts:\\nWhat this means is that you can trade only one or two contracts, nothing in between. That's one of the\\nimperfections of most money-management systems.\\nSticking to 10 percent: Gann\\nWilliam Gann developed a complicated system for identifying securities trades. Part of his system was a\\nlist of rules for managing money, and many traders follow that if nothing else.\\n The primary rule is this: Divide your money into ten equal parts and never place more than one\\n10 percent portion on a single trade. This strategy helps control your risk, whether or not you use\\nGann. (Gann is discussed in Chapter 7.)\\nFinding the ideal percentage: Kelly Criterion\\nThe Kelly Criterion lets you determine the ideal percentage of your portfolio to put at risk. To calculate\\nhow much of your portfolio to put at risk, you need to know what percentage of your trades are\\nexpected to win, the return from a winning trade, and the ratio performance of winning trades to losing\\ntrades. The shorthand that many traders use for the Kelly Criterion is edge divided by odds, and in\\npractice, the formula looks like this:\\nW is the percentage of winning trades, and R is the ratio of the average gain of the winning trades\\nrelative to the average loss of the losing trades.\\nTo see this formula in action, consider a system that loses 40 percent of the time with a loss of 1 percent\\nand that wins 60 percent of the time with a gain of 1.5 percent. (Look familiar? I used this same\\nexample at the beginning of the chapter.) Plugging that info into the Kelly formula, the right percentage\\nto trade is 33.3 percent:\\nIn this situation, as long as you limit your trades to no more than 33 percent of your capital, you should\\nnever run out of money. The problem, of course, is that if you have a long string of losses, you can find\\nyourself with too little money to execute a trade. Many traders use a “half-Kelly” strategy, limiting each\\ntrade to half the amount indicated by the Kelly Criterion, as a way to keep the trading account from\\nshrinking too quickly. They are especially likely to do this if the Kelly Criterion generates a number\\ngreater than about 20 percent, as it does in this example.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 88}),\n",

The goal was to figure out the best ways to manage signal-noise issues in long-distance\\ntelephone communications. Very quickly, the mathematicians who worked on it saw that it could\\nbe applied to gambling, and in no time, the formula took off. In fact, a math professor, Edward\\nO. Thorpe, used the Kelly Criterion with great success to win big at blackjack in Las Vegas in the\\nearly 1960s, which led to a change in casino rules.\\nIn a casino, the rules are against you. If you find an edge, in no time, you'll be asked to leave, and the\\nrules may be changed. In the financial markets, the odds are even or slightly in your favor, so you have\\na better opportunity to make money by practicing your strategies.\\nDoubling down: Martingale\\nThe martingale style of money management is common with serious casino gamblers, and many traders\\napply it as well. It's designed to improve the amount of money you can earn in a game that has even\\nodds. Most casino odds favor the house (roulette wheels used to be evenly black and red, but casinos\\nfound that they could make more money if they inserted a green slice for zero, thus throwing off the\\nodds). Day trading, on the other hand, is a zero-sum game, especially in the options and futures markets.\\nFor every winner, there is a loser, so the odds of any one trade being successful are even. The\\nmartingale system is designed to work in any market where the odds are even or in your favor.\\nUnder the martingale strategy, you start with a set amount per trade, say $2,000. If your trade succeeds,\\nyou trade another $2,000. If your trade loses, you double your next order (after you close or limit the\\nfirst trade) so that you can win back your loss. (You may have heard gamblers talk about doubling\\ndown? Well, this is what they're doing.)\\n Under the martingale system, you always come out ahead as long as you have an infinite\\namount of money to trade. See the problem? You can run out of money before you have a trade\\nthat works. The market, on the other hand, has almost infinite resources because of the huge\\nvolume of participants coming and going all over the world. In short, you're at an enormous\\ndisadvantage. As long as you have a disadvantage, thoughtful money management is critical.\\nLetting a program guide you: Monte Carlo simulation\\nIf you have the programming expertise or buy the right software, you can run what's called a Monte\\nCarlo simulation, named for the famous casino town. In this calculation, you enter in your risk and\\nreturn parameters and your account value and let the program run. It then returns the optimal trade size.\\nThe system is not perfect; it can't incorporate every market situation that you'll face, and it has the\\nfractional trade problem that the other systems do. But it has one big advantage: It can incorporate\\nrandom changes in the markets in ways that simpler money-management models cannot.\\nThere are different schools of thought about the statistical theories that go into a Monte Carlo\\nsimulation. Fortunately, you don't have to know them to use the system's estimates of the return in the\\nmarket to help you determine your position sizes as the market changes.\\n A Monte Carlo simulation is more dynamic than most of the other money-management\\nsystems, but it isn't as easy to use. For that reason, it isn't a do-it-yourself project unless you have\\nextensive experience creating these programs. If you are interested, you need to find a suitable\\nprogram.

The\\nidea is that you determine the ideal fraction of your money to allocate per trade based on past\\nperformance. If your Optimal F is 18 percent, then each trade should be 18 percent of your account —\\nno more, no less. The system is similar to the fixed-fraction and fixed-ratio methods discussed earlier\\nbut with a few differences.\\nTo find the number of shares of stock, N, to trade under Optimal F, you use this equation:\\nF is a factor based on the basis of historical data, risk is the biggest percentage loss that you experienced\\nin the past, equity is the amount of money in your account, and price is the current price. Using these\\nnumbers, you can find the contracts or shares you need to buy.\\nHere's an example: Assume your account has $25,000, your biggest loss (risk) was 40 percent, your F is\\n30 percent, and you're looking at a stock trading at $25 per share. Plug in the numbers and calculation to\\nfind that you should buy 750 shares:\\nThe Optimal F number itself is a mean based on historical trade results. The risk number is also based\\non past returns, and that's one problem with this method: It kicks in only after you have some trade data.\\nA second problem is that you need to set up a spreadsheet to calculate it (so read Ralph Vince's book if\\nyou want to try it out). Some traders only use Optimal F in certain market conditions, in part because\\nthe history changes each time a trade is made, and that history doesn't always lead to usable numbers.\\nSeeing How Money Management Af fects Your\\nReturn\\nDescribing why you need money management is one thing, but showing you how it works is more fun.\\nAnd because I love making spreadsheets (we all need a hobby, right?), I pulled one together to show\\nyou how different ways of managing your money may affect your return.\\nIn Figure 6-2, I started with the expected return assumptions that I used in the earlier example: 40\\npercent of the time a trade loses, and it loses 1 percent. The trade wins 60 percent of the time, and\\nwinning trades are up 1.5 percent. I pick a hypothetical account of $20,000 and set up mock trades using\\nthese expected return numbers.

(Keep in\\nmind that if you were using a Kelly or martingale system, you'd probably be doing something with the\\nrest of the account rather than just letting it sit there.)\\n This is just an example, applying some different strategies to different hypothetical returns. I'm\\nnot recommending any one system over another. The best system for you depends on what assets\\nyou're trading, your personal trading style, and how much money you have to trade.\\nPlanning for Y our Profits\\nIn addition to determining how much to trade each time you place an order, you need a plan for what to\\ndo with the profits that accumulate in your account.

Although day traders earn little to no interest (which is\\ncompensation for loaning out money — say, by buying bonds), the basic principle holds: By returning\\nprofits to the trading account to generate even more profits, the account should grow over time.\\n This practice of keeping profits in the account to trade makes a lot of sense for smaller traders\\nwho want to build their accounts and take more significant positions over time.\\nPyramiding power\\nPyramiding involves taking trading profits and borrowing heavily against them to generate even more\\nprofits. Traders usually do this during the day, using unrealized profits in trades that are not yet closed\\nas collateral for loans used to establish new positions. If the new positions are profitable, the trader can\\nkeep borrowing until it's time to close everything at the end of the day.\\n Pyramiding works great as long as the markets are moving in the right direction. If all the\\npositions in the pyramid remain profitable, you can make a lot of money during the course of the\\nday. But if one of those positions turns against you, then the structure collapses and you end up\\nwith a call on your margin.\\nFigure 6-3 starts with an initial trade of $2,000 and assumes a return of 10 percent on each transaction\\n— not realistic, necessarily, but it makes for a nice chart. If the profits from each trade are used as\\ncollateral for borrowing, and if that 10 percent return holds all day, then the trader can make 17 percent\\nby pyramiding those gains. If a reversal hits before the end of the trading session and the positions lose\\n10 percent, then pyramiding magnifies the losses — assuming your broker would let you keep\\nborrowing.

In trading terms, pyramiding is a way to\\nborrow against your profits to generate even bigger profits. A pyramid scheme is a fraud that\\nrequires participants to recruit new members, and fees paid by the new members go to the older\\nones. Eventually, the pyramid collapses because recruiting new members gets too difficult and\\nthose at the bottom get nothing. Be aware that some investment frauds have been structured as\\npyramid schemes. Steer clear of deals that sound fabulous and require you to recruit others.\\nPyramiding increases your trading risk but also your expected return.

One way to\\ndo this is to pull money out of the trading account to put into a less volatile long-term investment. Many\\ntraders routinely pull out a percentage of their profits and put that money into government bonds, a low-\\nrisk mutual fund, or real estate.

Two primary\\ntypes of investment research systems exist: technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Technical\\nanalysis, which is widely used by day traders, looks at the supply and demand for a security and how it\\nshows up in price data.

Is the price going up a lot as they buy more, or does the price go up just a\\nlittle bit? Does it seem like everyone who is likely to buy has already bought, and what does that\\nmean for the future price?\\nWhat direction is your research?\\nSecurities are affected by matters specific to each type and by huge global macroeconomic factors that\\naffect every security in different ways. Some traders prefer to think of the big picture first, whereas\\nothers start small. And some use a combination of the two approaches. Neither is better; each is simply\\na different perspective on what's happening in the markets.\\nTop-down research\\nWith a top-down approach, the trader looks at the big economic factors: interest rates, exchange rates,\\ngovernment policies, and the like. How will these things affect a particular sector or security? Is this a\\ngood time to buy stocks or short interest-rate futures? The top-down approach can help evaluate the\\nprices in big market sectors, and it can also help determine what factors are affecting trading in a\\nsubsector. You don't have to trade stock market index futures to know that the outlook for the overall\\nstock market will have an effect on the trading of any specific company's stock.\\nBottom-up research\\nBottom-up analysis looks at the specific performance of the asset. It looks at the company's prospects\\nand then works backward to figure out how it will get there. What has to happen for a company's stock\\nprice to go up 20 percent? What earnings does it have to report, what types of buyers have to\\nmaterialize, and what else has to happen in the economy?\\nFundamental research\\nDay traders do very little fundamental research. Sure, they know that demand for ethanol affects corn\\nprices, but they really want to know what the price will do right now relative to where the price was a\\nfew minutes ago. How a proposed farm bill might affect ethanol prices in six years doesn't figure into\\nday trading.\\nKnowing a little bit about the fundamentals — those basic facts that affect the supply and demand for a\\nsecurity in all markets — can help the day trader respond better to news events. It can also give you a\\nbetter feel for when swing trading (holding a position for several days) will generate a better profit than\\nclosing out every night. But knowing a lot can drag a day trader down.\\n Fundamental analysis can actually hurt you in day trading, because you may start making\\ndecisions for the wrong reasons. If you know too much about the fundamentals, you may start\\nconsidering long-term outlooks instead of short-term activity. For example, many people buy\\nStandard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index mutual funds for their retirement accounts because they\\nbelieve that in the long run, the market will go up. That does not mean that people should trade E-\\nmini S&P futures or an S&P exchange-traded fund today, because a lot of zigzagging can happen\\nbetween now and the arrival of the long-run price appreciation.\\nFundamental research falls into two main categories: top-down and bottom-up. As I mention earlier,\\ntop-down starts with broad economic considerations and then looks at how those will affect a specific\\nsecurity.

The plots\\nform patterns that can be analyzed to show what happened. How did the supply and demand for a\\nsecurity change, and why? And what does that mean for future supply and demand?

In an efficient market, all information about a\\nsecurity is already included in the security's price, so there's no point to doing any research at all. Few\\nmarket participants are willing to go that far, but they concede the point that the price is the single most\\nimportant summary of information about a company. That means that technical analysis, looking at how\\nthe price changes over time, is a way of learning about whether a security's prospects are improving or\\ngetting worse.\\nVolume changes\\nThe basic bar shows how price changed during the day, but adding volume information tells the other\\npart of the story: how much of a security was demanded at that price. If demand is going up, then more\\npeople want the security, so they are willing to pay more for it.

Some day traders find that simply moving between buying at the support and selling at the\\nresistance can be a profitable strategy, at least until something happens that changes those two levels.\\nCalculating indicators\\nIn addition to drawing lines, technical analysts use their calculators — or have their software make\\ncalculations — to come up with different indicators, numbers used to gauge performance. The\\nfollowing sections cover some common indicators, with definitions.\\nPivot points\\nA pivot point is the average of the high, low, and close price for the day. If the next day's price closes\\nabove the pivot point, that sets a new support level, and if the next day's price is below the pivot point,\\nthat sets a new resistance level. Hence, calculating pivot points and how they change may indicate new\\nupper and lower stops for your trading. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more about using stops.)\\n For markets that are open more or less continuously, such as foreign exchange, the close price\\nis set arbitrarily.

To\\nmake the trend easier to spot, traders calculate a moving average by averaging the closing prices for a\\ngiven time period. Some traders prefer to look at the last 5 days; some at the last 60 days. Every day, the\\nlatest price is added, and the oldest price is dropped to make that day's calculation. Given the wonders\\nof modern computing technology, pulling up moving averages for almost any time period you want is\\neasy. The average for each day is then plotted against the price chart to show how the trend is changing\\nover time.

       " Document(page_content=\"102Price trends tend to move in cycles that can be seen on the charts or observed in market behavior.\\nKnowing the phases of a trend can help you better evaluate what's happening. Here is a summary of\\nsome phases of a trend:\\nAccumulation: This is the first part of the trend, where traders get excited about a security and its\\nprospects. They start new positions or add to existing ones.\\nMain phase (also called continuation): Here, the trend moves along nicely, with no unusual price\\naction. The highs get higher on an uptrend, and the lows get lower on a downtrend. A trader may\\nmake money — but not big money — following the trend here.\\nConsolidation (also called congestion): This phase indicates a sideways market. The security stays\\nwithin the trend but without hitting higher highs or lower lows. It just stays within the trading\\nrange. A consolidation phase is good for scalpers, who make a large volume of trades in search of\\nvery small profits. It can be boring for everyone else.\\nRetracement (also called correction or pullback): Retracement is a secondary trend, a short-term\\npullback away from the main trend to the support level. Retracements create buying opportunities,\\nbut they can also kill day traders who are following the trend.\\nDistribution: In the distribution phase, traders don't think that the security can go up in price any\\nmore. Hence, they tend to sell in large volume.\\nReversal: At this point, the trend changes. It's time to sell if you've been following an uptrend and\\nbuy if you've been following a downtrend. Many reversals follow classic patterns, which are\\ndiscussed later in this chapter.\\nThose ever-changing trends\\nAlthough technical traders look to follow trends, they also look for situations where the trend changes\\nso that they can find new profit opportunities. In general, day traders are going to follow trends, and\\nswing traders — those who hold securities for a few days or even weeks — are going to be more\\ninterested in identifying changes that may play out over time.\\nMonitoring momentum\\nFollowing the trend is great, but if the trend is moving quickly, you want to know so that you can get\\nahead of it. If the rate of change on the trend is going up, then rising prices are likely to occur.\\nTo calculate momentum, take today's closing price for a security, divide that by the closing price ten\\ndays ago, and then multiply the result by 100. This gives you a momentum indicator. If the price didn't\\ngo anywhere, the momentum indicator is 100. If the price went up, the indicator is greater than 100.\\nAnd if the price went down, the indicator is less than 100.\\nIn technical analysis, trends are usually expected to continue, so a security with a momentum indicator\\nabove 100 is expected to keep going up, all else being equal. But that “all else being equal” is the sticky\\npart. Technical analysts usually track momentum indicators over time to see whether the positive\\nmomentum is, itself, a trend. In fact, momentum indicators are a good confirmation of the underlying\\ntrend.\\n Momentum is a leading technical indicator. It tells you what is likely to happen in the future,\\nnot what has happened in the past.\\nMomentum trading is usually done with some attention to the fundamentals. When key business\\nfundamentals, such as sales or profits, are accelerating at the same time that the security is going up in\\nprice, the momentum is likely to continue for some time.

During these times, the ability to size up the\\nintelligence of the other traders in the market can come in handy.\\nGood technical analysts look at several different indicators to determine whether a change in trend is\\nreal or just one of those things that goes away quickly as the old trend resumes. For example, they may\\nlook at short interest or overall market volatility. You can learn more about these indicators in Chapter\\n8.\\nReading the Charts\\nHow long does it take to find the trend? How long does it take for the trend to play out? When do you\\nact on it?

And when the trend changes, the prices fall.\\nAn upside-down head and shoulders sometimes appears at the end of a downtrend, and it signals that\\nthe security is about to increase in price.\\nDrink from a cup and handle\\nWhen a security hits a peak in price and falls, sometimes because of bad news, it can stay low for a\\nwhile. But eventually, the bad news works itself out, the underlying fundamentals improve, and the time\\ncomes to buy again. The technical analyst sees this scenario play out in a cup and handle formation, and\\nFigure 7-11 shows you what one looks like.\\nFigure 7-1 1: A cup and handle formation is a long-term trend.\\nThe handle forms as those who bought at the old high and who felt burned by the decline take their\\nmoney and get out. But other traders, those who haven't the same history with the security, recognize\\nthat the price will probably resume going up now that those old sellers are out of the market.\\nA cup and handle formation generally shows up over a long period of trading — sometimes as long as a\\nyear — and many subtrends occur during that time. As a day trader, you'll probably care more about\\nthose day-to-day changes than the underlying trend taking place. Still, if you see that cup formation and\\nthe hint of a handle, you can interpret that as a sign that the security will probably start to rise in price.\\nMind the gap\\nGaps are breaks in prices that show up all the time, usually when some news event takes place between\\ntrading sessions that causes an adjustment in prices and volume. Whether the news is about an\\nacquisition, a product line disappointment, or a war that broke out overnight, it's significant enough to\\nchange the trend, and that's why traders pay attention when they see gaps.\\nA gap is a break between two bars, as shown in Figure 7-12.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 105}),\n",

Many traders view the security going up in price as a great\\ntime to sell, so the day trader who buys on the gap up immediately gets slammed by all the selling\\npressure. For that reason, some day traders prefer to wait at least 30 minutes before trading on an\\nopening gap, while others rely on their knowledge of the buyers and sellers in a given market to\\ndecide what to do.\\nGrab your pitchforks!\\nA pitchfork is sometimes called an Andrews pitchfork after Alan Andrews, the technical analyst who\\npopularized it.

If one strikes your fancy,\\nyou can look in the appendix for resources to help you learn more.\\nDow Theory\\nThe Dow Theory was developed by Charles Dow, the founder of The Wall Street Journal. The theory\\nand the market indexes that are part of it helped sell newspapers; they also helped people make money\\nin the markets. The Dow Theory is the basis for the traditional technical analysis described in this\\nchapter.\\nDow believed that securities move in trends, that the trends form patterns that traders can identify, and\\nthat those trends remain in place until some major event takes place that changes them. Further, trends\\nin the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Dow Jones Transportation Average can predict overall\\nmarket performance.\\nNot all technicians believe that the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Jones Transportation\\nAverage are primary indicators in the modern economy, but they rely on the Dow Theory for their\\nanalysis, and they still read the Journal.\\nFibonacci numbers and the Elliott Wave\\nRemember back when you had to take standardized tests, you'd often have to figure the next number in\\na series? Well, here's such a test. What's the next number in this series? (Hint: This is not a phone\\nnumber in Chad.)\\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21\\nIf you answered 34, you're right! The series is known as the Fibonacci numbers, sometimes called the\\nFibonacci series or just the Fibs. You find this number by adding together the preceding two numbers in\\nthe series, starting with the first two digits on the number line. 0 + 1 = 1; 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 2 = 3; and so on\\ninto infinity. Furthermore, when the series gets well into the double digits, the ratio of one number to the\\none next to it settles at 0.618, a number known as the golden ratio, which means that the ratio of the\\nsmaller and the larger of two numbers is the same as the ratio of the larger number to the sum of the two\\nnumbers. In nature, this is the proportion of a perfect spiral, like that found on a pinecone and a\\npineapple.\\nRalph Elliott was a trader who believed that over the long run the market moved in waves described by\\nthe Fibonacci series. For example, Elliott believed that a bull market would be characterized by three\\ndown waves and five up waves. He also believed that support and resistance levels would be found 61.8\\npercent above lows and below highs. Under the Elliott Wave system, if a security falls 61.8 percent\\nfrom a high, it's a good time to buy.\\nElliott believed that these waves ranged from centuries to minutes, so both traders and investors use the\\nsystem to identify the market trends that suit their timeframes. Others — including me — think it's\\nhighly unlikely that the human activity in the stock market would follow the same natural order as the\\nratio of the spiral on a mollusk shell.\\nJapanese candlestick charting\\nCandlestick charts were developed by traders in the Japanese rice futures markets in the 18th century,\\nand they've carried through into the present. The basic charts are similar to the high-low-close-open bars\\nthat I talk about earlier in this chapter, but they are shaped a little differently to carry more information.\\nFigure 7-14 shows an example of a candlestick.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 107}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"108\\nFigure 7-14:  Candlesticks are like slightly more sophisticated bars.\\nThe length of the rectangle (the so-called candle, also known as the body) between the open and the\\nclose prices gives a sense of how much volatility the security has, especially relative to the high and low\\nprices above and below the rectangle (the so-called wick, also known as the shadow). The shapes and\\ncolors create different patterns that traders can use to discern the direction of future prices. (Most\\ntechnical-analysis packages color the candlesticks green on up days and red on down days, to make\\nfinding trends even easier.)\\nThe Gann system\\nWilliam Gann supposedly made $50 million in the stock and commodities markets in the first half of\\nthe 20th century by using a system that he may or may not have taught to others before his death. A lot\\nof mystery and mythology surrounds the Gann system; some traders rely on what they perceive to be his\\nmethod, whereas others dismiss it, in part because Gann relied on astrology to build his forecasts.\\nThe Gann system, as it is defined nowadays, looks at the relationship between price and time. If a\\nsecurity moves one point in one day, that's a 1 × 1 Gann angle, and that's normal trading. If a security\\nmoves two points in one day, it is said to create a 2 × 1 Gann angle, which is bullish. An angle of less\\nthan 1 × 1 is bearish.\\nFurthermore, Gann recognized that the market moves back and forth while in a general upward or\\ndownward cycle, but some of those fluctuations are more positive than others. Just as the system looks\\nfor price movements over time with even proportions (1 × 1, 2 × 1, and so on), it also looks for orderly\\nretracements. When a security moves back 50 percent, say from a low of $20 to a high of $40 and then\\nback to $30, it would be a good time to buy under the Gann system.\\n Many traders swear by the 50 percent retracement guide — even those who think that Gann is\\nan otherwise crazy system. This may be the origin of one hoary trading chestnut: Buy whenever a\\nprice dips, because it's likely to be heading on its way back up.\\nAvoiding T echnical-Analysis Pitfalls\\nA lot of people make a lot of money selling services to day traders. They produce videos, organize\\nseminars, and (ahem) write books to tell you how to be a success. But in the financial world, success is\\na combination of luck, skill, and smarts.\\n Before you commit wholeheartedly to any particular school of research and before you plunk\\ndown a lot of money for some “proven” system demonstrated on an infomercial, think about who\\nare you are and what you are trying to do.

Keep them in mind as you\\ndevelop your day-trading business plan.\\nIf it's obvious, there's no opportunity\\nMany day trading systems work much of the time. For example, a security gaps up, meaning that, due to\\npositive news or high demand, the price jumps from one trade to the next (refer to Figure 7-12 for a gap\\nformation). This is good, and the security is likely to keep going up. So you buy the security, you make\\nmoney. Bingo! But here's the thing: Everyone is looking at that gap, everyone is assuming that the stock\\nwill go up, so everyone buys, and that bids up the security. The profit opportunity is gone. So maybe\\nyou're better off going short? Or avoiding the situation entirely? Who knows? And that's the problem.\\nLooking for obvious patterns like gaps tells you a lot about what is happening in the market, but only\\nyour own judgment and experience can tell you what the next move should be.\\nOveranalyzing the data\\nTechnical analysis is a useful way to gauge market psychology. That's what it was designed to do.\\nHowever, when it was developed, most traders were human beings, with all their crazy human\\nemotions. Nowadays, you aren't trading against a person. In almost all cases, you will be trading against\\nmachines that do what they are programmed to do. They don't suffer from doubt, fear, or greed — but\\nyou do. The market is an aggregation of everyone in it, but you don't want to assign human emotions to\\nnonhumans.\\nWhen trying to determine the mood of the market, you can easily start overanalyzing and working\\nyourself into a knot. Should you follow the trend or trade against it? But if everyone trades against it,\\nwould you be better off following it?\\nInstead of puzzling over what's really going on, develop a system that you trust. Do that through\\nbacktesting, simulation, and performance analysis. Chapter 16 has plenty of advice on how to use these\\ntechniques. The more confident you feel in how you should react given a market situation, the better\\nyour trading will be.\\nSuccess may be the result of an upward bias\\nUnder the efficient markets theory, all information is already included in a security's price. Until new\\ninformation comes into the market, the prices move in a random pattern, so any security is as likely to\\ndo as well as any other. In some markets, like the stock market, this random path has an upward bias,\\nmeaning that as long as the economy is growing, companies should perform well, too; therefore, the\\nmovement is more likely to be upward than downward, but the magnitude of the movement is random.\\nIf price movements are random, some people are going to win and some are going to lose, no matter\\nwhat systems they use to pick securities. If price movements are random with an upward bias, then\\nmore people are going to win than lose, no matter what systems they use to pick securities. Some of\\nthose who win are going to tout their systems, even though random chance was really what led to their\\nsuccess.\\n Technical analysis is a useful way to measure the relative supply and demand in the market,\\nand that in turn is a way to gauge the psychology of those who are trading. But it's not perfect.\\nBefore you plunk down a lot of money to learn a complex trading system or to subscribe to a\\nnewsletter offering a can't-miss method of trading, ask yourself if the person selling it is smart or\\njust lucky.

To get a sense of who is projecting a profit, traders look at the number of buy orders coming in,\\nhow large they are, and at what price. I cover volume and price indicators in more detail later in the\\nchapter.\\n Because there are so many good reasons to sell but only one good reason to buy, the market\\ncan take a long time to recognize bearish (pessimistic) sentiment indicators.

If the price is high and\\ngoing up, then the fundamentals are doing well. If the price is low and going lower, then something's\\nnot good. And everything in between means something else.\\nThe change in a security's price gives you a first cut of information. Price changes can be analyzed in\\nother ways to help you know when to buy or when to sell.\\nMomentum\\nMomentum, which is also discussed in Chapter 7, is the rate at which a security's price is increasing (or\\ndecreasing). If momentum is strong and positive, then the security shows both higher highs and higher\\nlows. People want to buy the security for whatever reason, and the price reflects that. Likewise,\\nmomentum can be strong and negative. Negative momentum is marked with lower highs and lower\\nlows. No one seems interested in buying, and that keeps dragging the price down.\\nThe exact amount of momentum that a security has can be measured with indicators known as\\nmomentum oscillators. A classic momentum oscillator starts with the moving average, which is the\\naverage of the closing prices for a past time period, say the last ten trading days. Then the change in\\neach day's moving average is plotted below the price line. When the oscillator is positive, traders say\\nthat the security is overbought; when it's negative, they say that the security is oversold.

Traders who see that a security is overbought want to sell in advance of those people.\\nIf a momentum oscillator shows that a security is oversold (the line is below the center line), the\\nsecurity is probably too cheap. Everyone who wanted to get out has gotten out, and now it may be a\\nbargain. When the buyers who see the profit opportunity jump in, the price goes up.\\n The trend is your friend .\\u2009.\\u2009. until the end. Although great reasons exist to follow price trends,\\nremember that they all end, so you still need to pay attention to your money management and your\\nstops, no matter how strong a trend seems to be.\\n Given that most trends end — or at least zig and zag along the way — some traders look for\\nsecurities that fit what they call the 1-2-3-4 criterion. If a security goes up in price for three\\nconsecutive days, then it's likely to go down on the fourth day. Likewise, if a security has fallen in\\nprice for three days in a row, it's likely to be up on day four. Be sure to run some simulations (see\\nChapter 16) to see whether this strategy works for a market that interests you.\\nTrading on the tick\\nA tick is an upward or downward price change. For some securities, such as futures contracts, the tick\\nsize is defined as part of the contract. For others, such as stocks, a tick can be anywhere from a penny to\\ninfinity (at least in theory).\\nYou can also calculate the tick indicator for the market as a whole. (In fact, most quotation systems\\ncalculate the market tick for you.) The tick for the market is the total number of securities in that market\\nthat traded up on the last trade minus the number that traded down on the last trade. If the tick is a\\npositive number, that's good: The market as a whole has a lot of buying interest. Although any given\\nsecurity may not do as well, a positive tick shows that most people in the market have a positive\\nperspective right now.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 113}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"1 14By contrast, a negative tick shows that most people in the market are watching prices fall. Sure, some\\nprices are going up, but unhappy people outnumber happy ones (assuming that most people are trading\\non the long side, meaning that they make money when prices go up, not down). This shows that the\\nsentiment is negative in the market right now.\\nTracking the trin\\nTrin is short for trading indicator, and it's another measure of market sentiment based on how many\\nprices have gone up relative to how many have gone down. Most quotation systems pull up the trin for a\\ngiven market, but you can also calculate it on your own. The math looks like this:\\nThe numerator is based on the tick: the number of securities that went up divided by (not less) the\\nnumber that went down. The denominator includes the volume: the number of shares or contracts that\\ntraded for those securities that went up divided by the number of securities traded for those that went\\ndown in price. This solution tells you just how strongly buyers supported the securities that were going\\nup and just how much selling pressure faced those securities that went down.\\nA trin of less than 1.00 usually means that a lot of buyers are taking securities up in price, and that's\\npositive. A trin above 1.00 indicates that the sellers are acting more strongly, which means a lot of\\nnegative sentiment is in the market.\\nVolume\\nThe trin indicator looks at price in conjunction with volume. Volume tells you how much trading is\\ntaking place in the market. How excited are people about the current price? Do they see this as a great\\nopportunity to buy or to sell? Are they selling fast, to get out now, or are they taking a more leisurely\\napproach to the market these days? This information is carried in the volume of the trading, and it's an\\nimportant adjunct to the information you see in the prices. Volume tells you whether enough support\\nexists to maintain price trends or whether price trends are likely to change soon.\\nForce index\\nThe force index gives you a sense of the strength of a trend. It starts with information from prices,\\nnamely that if the closing price today is higher than the closing price yesterday, that's positive for the\\nsecurity. Conversely, if today's closing price is lower than yesterday's, then the force is generally\\nnegative. Then that price information is combined with volume information. The more volume that goes\\nwith that price change, the stronger that positive or negative force.\\nAlthough many quotation systems calculate force for you, you can do it yourself, too. For each trading\\nday, run this calculation:\\nForce index = volume × (today's moving average – yesterday's moving average)\\nIn other words, the force index simply scales the moving average momentum oscillator (discussed in the\\nearlier section “Pinpointing with price indicators”) for the amount of volume that accompanies that\\nprice change. That way, the trader has a sense of just how overbought or oversold the security is on any\\nparticular day.\\nOn-balance volume\\nThe on-balance volume is a running total of the amount of trading in a security. To calculate the on-\\nbalance volume, first look at today's closing price relative to yesterday's and then do one of the\\nfollowing:\\nIf today's close is higher than yesterday's: Add today's volume to yesterday's on-balance volume.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 114}),\n",

Today's balance is the same as\\nyesterday's.\\nMany traders track on-balance volume over time, and here's why: A change in volume signals a change\\nin demand. The change in demand may not show up in price right away if enough buyers exist to absorb\\nvolume from sellers. But if still more buyers are out there, then the price is going to go up. Hence, the\\nvolume from even small day-to-day increases in price need to be added up over time. If the volume\\nkeeps going up, then at some point, prices are going to have to go up to meet the demand.\\nOn the downside, the volume from small price declines add up over time, too. Over time, this volume\\nmay show that very little pent-up interest exists, indicating that prices could languish for some time.\\n Many traders look to on-balance volume to gauge the behavior of so-called smart money, such\\nas pension funds, hedge funds, and mutual fund companies. Unlike individual investors, these big\\ninstitutional accounts tend to trade on fundamentals rather than emotion. They generally start\\nbuying a security at the point where the dumb money is tired of owning it, so their early buying\\nmay show big volume with little price change. But as the institutions keep buying, the price has to\\ngo up to get the smarter individuals and the early institutions to part with their shares.\\nOpen interest\\nOpen interest has a different meaning in the stock market than in the options and futures markets, but in\\nboth cases, it gives traders useful information about demand:\\nIn the stock market, open interest is the number of buy orders submitted before the market opens.\\nWhen the open interest is high, people are ready to add shares to their positions or initiate new\\npositions, which means that the stock is likely to go up in price on the demand.\\nIn the options and futures markets, open interest is the number of contracts at the end of every day\\nthat have not been exercised, closed out, or allowed to expire.\\nDay traders don't have open interest, because by definition, day traders close out at the end of every day.\\nBut some traders keep open interest, either because they think that their position has the ability to\\nincrease in profitability or because they're hedging another transaction and need to keep that options or\\nfutures position in place. If open interest in a contract is increasing, new money is coming into the\\nmarket, and prices are likely to continue to go up. This is especially true if volume is increasing at about\\nthe same rate as open interest. On the other hand, if open interest is falling, people are closing out their\\npositions because they no longer see a profit potential, and prices are likely to fall.\\nVolatility, crisis, and opportunity\\nThe volatility of a security is a measure of how much that security tends to go up or down in a given\\ntime period. The more volatile the security, the more the price fluctuates. Most day traders prefer\\nvolatile securities, because they create more opportunities to make a profit in a short amount of time.\\nBut volatility can make gauging market sentiment tougher. If a security is volatile, the mood can change\\nquickly. What looked like a profit opportunity at the market open may be gone by lunchtime — and\\nback again before the close.\\nAverage true range\\nThe average true range is a measure of volatility that's commonly used in commodity markets, but\\nsome stock traders use it, too. It's a measure of how much volatility occurred each day. When averaged\\nover time, this measure shows how much volatility takes place during the period in question. The higher\\nthe average true range is, the more volatile a security is.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 115}),\n",

The number comes from the capital assets pricing model, which\\nis an equation used in academic circles to model the performance of securities. Traders don't use the\\ncapital assets pricing model, but they often talk about beta to evaluate the volatility of stocks and\\noptions.\\nWhat does beta mean?\\nA beta of 1.00 means that the security is moving at a faster rate than the market. You would buy\\nhigh betas if you think the market is going up but not if the market is going down.\\nA beta of less than 1.00 means that the security is moving more slowly than the market — a good\\nthing if you want less risk than the market.\\nA beta of exactly 1.00 means that the security is moving at the same rate as the market.\\nA negative beta means that the security is moving in the opposite direction of the market. The\\neasiest way to get a negative beta security is to short (borrow and then sell) a positive beta security.\\nThe VIX\\nVIX is short for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. Calculating VIX is complex\\nenough to border on being proprietary, but it's available on many quotation systems and on the\\nexchange's website, www.cboe.com/micro/vix/introduction.aspx.\\nThe VIX is based on the implied volatility of options on stocks included in the S&P 500 Index. The\\ngreater the volatility, the more uncertainty investors have; the more options that show great volatility,\\nthe more widespread is the concern about prospects for the financial markets. In fact, the VIX is often\\ncalled the fear index and is used to gauge the amount of negative sentiment investors have. The greater\\nthe VIX, the more bearish the outlook for the market in general. The more bearish the outlook, the more\\nlikely the market is to be volatile. And volatility is the day trader's best friend.\\nTraders can use the VIX to help them value options on the market indexes. (For that matter, traders who\\nwant to take a position on market volatility can use options and futures contracts on the VIX, including\\na mini-sized future, offered by the Chicago Board Options Exchange.) The VIX can also be used to help\\nconfirm bullish or bearish sentiment that shows up in other market signals, such as the tick or the on-\\nbalance volume measures described earlier. The CBOE also calculates a VIX number on a handful of\\ncommon stocks, if you are trading those issues or the options on them.\\nIn addition to the VIX, the exchange also tracks the VXN (volatility on the NASDAQ 100 Index) and\\nthe VXD (volatility on the Dow Jones Industrial Average).\\nVolatility ratio\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 116}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"1 17The volatility ratio tells traders what the implied volatility of a security is relative to the recent historical\\nvolatility. This ratio shows whether the security is expected to be more or less volatile right now than it\\nhas been in the past, and it's widely used in option markets. The first calculation required is the implied\\nvolatility, which is backed out using the Black-Scholes model, an academic model for valuing options.\\nWhen you plug in to the model certain variables — time until expiration, interest rates, dividends, stock\\nprice, and strike price — the implied volatility is the volatility number that then generates the current\\noption price. (You don't have to perform these calculations yourself because most quotation systems\\ngenerate implied volatility for you.)\\nAfter you have the implied volatility, you can compare it to the historical volatility of the option, which\\ntells you just how much the price changed over the last 20 or 90 days. If the implied volatility is greater\\nthan the statistical volatility, the market may be overestimating the uncertainty in the prices, and the\\noptions may be overvalued. If the implied volatility is much less than the statistical volatility, the market\\nmay be underestimating uncertainty, so the options may be undervalued.\\nMeasuring Money Flows\\nMoney flows tell you how much money is going into or out of a market. They are another set of\\nindicators telling you where the market sentiment is right now and where it may be going soon. Money-\\nflow indicators combine features of price and volume indicators to help traders gauge the market.\\nAlthough amounts spent to buy and sell have to match — otherwise, the market wouldn't exist — the\\nenthusiasm of the buyers and the anxiousness of the sellers show up in the volume traded and the\\ndirection of the price change. Just how hard was it for the buyers to get the sellers to part with their\\npositions? And how hard will it be to get them to part with their positions tomorrow? That's the\\ninformation contained in money-flow indicators.\\nThe most basic money-flow indicator is the change in closing price multiplied by the number of shares\\ntraded. If the closing price was higher than the closing price yesterday, then the number is positive; if\\nthe closing price today was lower than the price yesterday, then the number is negative. Other indicators\\nout there use midpoint values and don't go negative; instead, the numbers range from higher to lower.\\nWhether positive or negative, a high money flow indicates strong buying activity, and that indicates that\\na positive price trend is likely to continue.\\nAccumulation/distribution index\\nIn trading terms, accumulation is controlled buying, and distribution is controlled selling. This kind of\\nbuying and selling doesn't lead to big changes in securities prices, usually because the action was\\nplanned. No one accumulates or distributes a security in a state of panic.\\nBut even if the buying and selling activity isn't driven by madcap rushes in and out of positions, it's still\\nimportant to know whether, on balance, the buyers or the sellers have the slight predominance in the\\nmarket, because that may affect the direction of prices in the near future. For example, if a security has\\nbeen in an upward trend but more and more down days occur with increasing volume, the sellers are\\nstarting to dominate the trading, and the price trend is likely to go down.\\nTo determine the accumulation/distribution index, you use this equation:\\nSome traders look at accumulation/distribution from day to day, whereas others prefer to look at it for a\\nweek or even a month's worth of trading.

That basic statistic can be\\nmanipulated in strange and wonderful ways to generate new statistics carrying even more information\\nabout whether the markets are likely to have more buying pressure or more selling pressure in the\\nfuture.\\nThe first is the money-flow ratio, which is simply the total money flow for those days where prices were\\nup from the prior day (days with positive money flow) divided by the total money flow for those days\\nwhere prices were down from the prior day (which are the days with negative money flow). Day traders\\ntend to calculate money-flow ratios for short time periods, such as a week or ten days, whereas swing\\ntraders and investors tend to care about longer time periods, like a month or even four months of\\ntrading.\\nThe money-flow ratio is sometimes converted into the money-flow index, which can be used as a single\\nindicator or tracked relative to prices for a given period of time. The equation used to figure out the\\nmoney-flow index looks like this:\\nIf the money-flow index is more than 80, the security is usually considered to be overbought —\\nmeaning that the buyers are done buying, and the sellers will put downward pressure on prices. If the\\nmoney-flow index is less than 20, the security is usually considered to be oversold, and the buyers will\\nsoon take over and drive prices up. In between, the money-flow index can help clarify information from\\nother market indicators.\\nShort interest ratios\\nShort selling is a way to make money if a security falls in price. In the options and futures markets, one\\nsimply agrees to sell a contract to someone else. In the stock and bond markets, short selling is a little\\nmore complicated. The short seller borrows stock or bonds through the brokerage firm and then sells\\nthem. Ideally, the price falls, and then the trader can buy back the stock or bonds at the lower price to\\nrepay the loan. The trader keeps the difference between the security's selling price and its repurchasing\\nprice. (The process is described in more detail in Chapter 9.)\\nPeople take the short side of a position for only one reason: They think that prices are going to go down.\\nThey may want to hedge against this, or they may want to make a big profit if it happens. In the stock\\nmarket in particular, monitoring the rate of short selling can give clues to investor expectations and\\nfuture market direction.\\nThe New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ report the short interest in stocks listed with them. The\\ndata are updated monthly, as it can take a while for brokerage firms to sort out exactly how many shares\\nhave been shorted and then report that data to the exchanges. The resulting number, the short interest\\nratio, tells the number of shares that have been shorted, the percentage change from the month before,\\nthe average daily trading volume in the same month, and the number of days of trading at the average\\nvolume that covering the short positions would take.\\n The loans that enable short selling have to be repaid. If the lender asks for the securities back\\nor if prices go up so that the position starts to lose money, the trader is going to have to buy shares\\nto make repayment. The harder it is to get the right number of shares in the market, the more\\ndesperate the trader will become, and the higher prices will go.\\nAn increase in short interest shows that investors are becoming nervous about a stock.

An order imbalance means that the number\\nof buyers and sellers doesn't match. This situation often occurs during the open because some traders\\nprefer to place orders before the market opens, whereas others prefer to wait until after the open.

The market is always right in the short term.\\nA lot of people make money with a contrarian strategy, but they need to pay attention to avoid the traps.\\nCalendar effects\\nMany trading anomalies follow time periods — which is not completely unexpected — because many\\neconomic and business trends follow the calendar. Companies report their results quarterly. Most close\\ntheir books for tax purposes at the end of the year. Investors are also evaluated quarterly. Retail sales\\nfollow holiday seasons, demand for commodities follows the growing season, and fuel demand varies\\nwith the weather. Whatever you decide to trade, you need to do enough fundamental research (the study\\nof the business and economic factors that affect the security, described in Chapter 7) so that you know\\nhow your chosen securities move over time.\\nBut some of the calendar effects — the January effect, the Monday effect, and the October effect —\\nmake little logical sense, yet they still influence trading.\\nThe January ef fect\\nMany years, the stock market goes up in the early part of January. Why? No one is entirely sure, but the\\nguess is that people tend to sell at the end of December for tax reasons and then buy back those\\nsecurities in January. It may also be that in the new year everyone is flush with excitement and ready to\\nsee the market go up, so they put money to work and start buying.\\n If stocks go up in January, then you can get a jump on the market by buying in December,\\nright? And that would make prices go up in December. To get a jump on the December rally, you\\ncould buy in November. And that's exactly what people started to do, and the once-pronounced\\nJanuary effect is now weak to nonexistent. (People still talk about it, though.) In an efficient\\nmarket, people eventually figure out these unexplained phenomena and then trade on them until\\nthey disappear. Use these anomalies as a way to gauge psychology, not as hard and fast trading\\nrules.\\nThe Monday ef fect\\nThe market seems to do more poorly on Monday than on the other days of the week. And no matter\\nwhat the evidence shows (the research is ambiguous, and the findings vary greatly based on the time\\nperiod and the markets examined), many traders believe this to be true, so it has an effect. Why? There\\nare two thoughts. The first is that people are in a bad mood on Monday because they have to go back to\\nwork after the weekend. The second is that people spend all weekend analyzing any bad news from the\\nend of the prior week and then sell as soon as they get back to the office.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

Over the previous weekend, the different\\nregulatory agencies decided to allow the old-line brokerage firm of Lehman Brothers to fail. The\\nfirm failed to open on Monday, September 15, and the rest of the market went into a tailspin.\\nThe October ef fect\\nThe stock market has had two grand crashes and one smaller but profound one in October:\\nOctober 29, 1929: On this day, known as Black Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average\\ndeclined 12 percent in one day as market speculators caught up with the less rosy reality of the\\neconomy. This crash kicked off a general decline that contributed to the Great Depression of the\\n1930s.\\nOctober 19, 1987: This day, known as Black Monday, saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average\\ndecline 23 percent. No one is really sure why this crash happened, but it did.\\nOctober 13, 1989: On this day, the Dow Jones declined 7 percent in the last hour of trading when a\\nleveraged buyout for United Airlines fell through.\\nBecause of these crashes, many traders believe that bad things happen in October, and they act\\naccordingly. Of course, bad things happen in other months. The crash in the NASDAQ market that\\nmarked the end of the 1990s tech bubble took place in March 2000, but no one talks about a March\\neffect. The 2008 crash took place in September; maybe, like the January effect, the October effect is\\nstarting to roll earlier into the year.\\nBuilding on Some Standard Strategies\\nThis chapter has a lot of information about different indicators that you can look at, and this information\\ncan be used to form all types of trading strategies. Many traders work out their own systems after\\nthey've been trading for a while, but they often start with something standardized.\\nYou can start trading in a lot of ways (many of which you can read about in this book; Chapter 13 in\\nparticular has advice on how to evaluate different trading systems that you can subscribe to, if you are\\nlooking for a system). In this section, I cover a few basic styles that you can use to launch your trading\\nbusiness. All the strategies outlined in the following sections are based on the indicators discussed in\\nthis chapter. They include range trading, or working within normal high and low movements;\\ncontrarian trading, or going against the momentum; news trading, or looking to buy and sell as soon as\\na juicy tidbit comes across the newswire; and pairs trading, in which a trader goes long a strong stock\\nand short a weaker one in the same category. The idea is that in an up market, gains on the long will\\noutpace losses on the short, and in a down market, gains on the short will outpace losses on the long.\\nNo one of these strategies is better than another. Each has advantages in different market conditions.\\nThe key is finding a strategy that fits your temperament and style so that you can act on it. A strategy is\\nonly as good as the trader who executes it.\\n Many brokerage firms offer practice accounts and backtesting services that you can use to play\\naround and see what fits. And then you can start working with real money.\\nRange trading\\nRange trading, sometimes called channel trading, starts with an understanding of the recent trading\\nhistory of a given security. Getting this history involves looking at the charts (see Chapter 7) to identify\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 123}),\n",

With\\nthis information, the trader simply buys low and sells high. When the security dips in price, the order to\\nbuy is placed; when it rises, the order to sell goes in.\\nMost range traders use stops and limits to keep their trading in line with what they see. Covered in more\\ndetail in Chapter 2, a stop limits the loss if the security keeps dropping below your entry point, and the\\nlimit order gets you out at a profit if the security moves to the top of the range.\\n Range trading works in a normal market with just enough volatility to keep the price wiggling\\naround during the day but not so much that it breaks out of the range and starts a new trend.\\nContrarian trading\\nMomentum traders buy securities when prices are rising and sell when prices are falling. These traders\\nfigure that something that goes up in price will continue to go up and something going down will\\ncontinue to go down. Momentum trading is one strategy, and it works well for many traders, especially\\nin a strong bull market.\\nContrarian trading, on the other hand, is just the opposite of momentum trading, and it can work well,\\ntoo. The logic behind a contrarian strategy is that nothing goes up forever; for that matter, nothing falls\\nforever, either. The contrarian trader looks for assets than have been rising in price and sells them; she\\nprefers to buy things that have been falling. The point is not to buy cheap or sell dear, but rather to sell\\nwhat seems to be overpriced and buy what seems to be a bargain. Contrarian traders may just be quick\\nto spot when a trend ends. For example, they may buy on a rumor and sell on the news, jumping out\\nright when everyone else is ready to jump in.\\nThe people I've known who use this strategy well tend to be bargain hunters in every aspect of their\\nlives. They stock up on frozen vegetables when the grocery store has a once-a-year loss leader, and they\\nsell their apartment if their neighborhood's real estate gets too hot. They have a nose for value and put\\nthat to work during the trading day.\\nContrarian traders are fighting the trend, and that can work against them sometimes. This style favors\\npeople who know a market inside and out so that they know when to move against it.\\nNews trading\\nNews trading is possibly the most traditional form of day trading. This type of trader doesn't pay much\\nattention to charts. Instead, he waits for information that will drive prices. This information may come\\nin the form of a company announcement about earnings or new products; a general economic\\nannouncement about interest rates or unemployment; or just a lot of rumors about what may or may not\\nbe happening in a given industry.\\nTraders who do well with news trading usually have some understanding of the markets they're working\\nin. They're not hard-core fundamental researchers, but they know enough to know what kind of news\\nwould be taken well by the markets and what would be taken poorly. They also have the attention span\\nneeded to pay attention to a few different news sources simultaneously, as well as the ability to place the\\norder when the time comes.\\nThe downside of news trading is that really good events may be few and far between; more often, the\\nhype is already built into the price by the time you see it. Also, news trading is difficult to automate,\\nalthough more and more computer programs draw signals from news and social-media feeds. You can't\\nplace a limit order to buy when a price level is hit; you have to wait until you see the news and then\\nplace the order yourself. Thus, news trading works well only for traders who can commit to placing the\\norder.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

The idea is to get the\\nmaximum return possible from a trend that affects both assets. For example, if one retail stock does\\nreally well, it may be because the company is taking market share from a weaker one. These trades are a\\nlittle more complex because you have to plan both sides.\\nDeveloping a Program\\nMost modern day traders find that they need to program their trades. By this, I mean that they need to\\ndetermine what they are trading, identify the signals they use to buy and sell securities, and set their\\ntrading platform to execute the orders automatically. Instead of working on your reflexes, you do the\\nwork of planning and testing.\\n Of course, a program is only as good as its inputs, and even the biggest of the big trading firms\\nhave had huge losses because of trading glitches.\\nYou don't need to be a software engineer to develop trading programs. Many of the charting services\\noffer program templates that you can follow or adapt; the brokerage firms that work with day traders\\noffer trading platforms that can be programmed without too much effort, usually by clicking on icons or\\ninserting widgets of prewritten code.\\nHow do you get started?\\nIf you already know a programming language, look for a broker or trading platform that uses it.\\nIf you don't know a programming language, expect to spend a lot of time and trial and error\\nlearning it. The broker probably has online tutorials; spend time with them. If you're stuck on\\nsomething, ask the broker's customer service rep for help and look for additional tutorials on\\nYouTube.\\nWrite out your process step by step with a pen on paper before you attempt to convert it to code.\\nBuy a book or take a class if you need more help.\\nAnd if the very idea of programming gives you the heebie-jeebies, consider another way to make\\nmoney!\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 125}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"126Chapter 9\\nIncreasing Risk and Potential Return\\nwith Short Selling and Leverage\\nIn This Chapter\\n Making money with other people's money\\n Garnering tall profits from short sales\\n Using leverage in every market you can imagine\\n Borrowing for business and personal needs\\n Considering the consequences of leverage\\nIn a certain sense, day trading isn't risky at all. Day traders close out their positions overnight to\\nminimize the possibility of something going wrong while the trader isn't paying attention. Each trade is\\nbased on finding a small price change in the market over a short period of time, so nothing is likely to\\nchange dramatically. But here's the thing: Trading this way leads to small returns. Trading full time is\\nhard to justify if you aren't making a lot of money when you do it, no matter how low your risk is.\\nAnd some days, there aren't many good trades to make. You may be looking for securities to go up, but\\nthey don't. Zero trades lead to zero risk — and zero return. For this reason, savvy traders think about\\nother ways to make money on their trades, even when doing so involves taking on more risk. That risk\\nis what generates the return that many traders crave.\\nIn this chapter, I cover two techniques for finding trades and increasing returns: short selling and\\nleverage. Both involve borrowing, and both increase risk.\\nThe Magic of Margin\\nThe dollars you make from trading depend on two things: your percentage return on your trades and the\\ndollars you have to start out with. If you double your money but have only a $1,000 account, you're left\\nwith $2,000. If you get a 10 percent return but have a $1,000,000 account, you make $100,000. Which\\nwould you rather have? (Yes, I know, you'd rather double your money with the $1,000,000 account. But\\nI didn't give you that choice, alas.)\\nThe point is that the more money you have to trade, the more dollars you can generate, even if the\\nreturn on the trade itself is small. If you have $500,000 and borrow $500,000 more, then your 10\\npercent return gives you $100,000 to take home, not $50,000. You've doubled the dollars returned to\\nyou by doubling the money you used to place the trades, not by doubling the performance of the trade\\nitself. Clever, huh?\\n Here are two important things to remember about borrowing, which is known in trading as\\nleverage:\\nLeverage gives you more money to trade, which helps you generate more dollars for your account\\n— or lose more dollars, if you aren't careful or have a string of reversals.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"127\\nWhen you borrow money or shares of stock, you have to pay it back, no matter what happens.\\nThat's why borrowing can be risky.\\nDay traders and other short-term traders aren't looking to make big money on any single trade. Instead,\\nthe goal is to make small money on a whole bunch of trades. Unfortunately, all those little trades don't\\neasily add up to something big. That's why many day traders turn to leverage. They either borrow\\nmoney or stock from their brokerage firm or they trade securities that have built-in leverage, such as\\nfutures and foreign exchange.\\nMaking margin agreements\\nLeverage not only adds risk to your own account but also adds risk to the entire financial system. If\\neveryone borrowed money and then some big market catastrophe happened, no one would be able to\\nrepay their loans, and the people who lent the money would go bust, too.\\nAs a result, an incredible amount of oversight goes with leverage strategies. The Securities and\\nExchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the different exchanges, and\\neven the U.S. Treasury Department regulate how much money a trader can borrow. Many brokerage\\nfirms have even stricter rules in place as part of their risk management, and they're expected to\\ndemonstrate to FINRA and the National Futures Association that they follow their practices.\\nThis extensive oversight means that you have about as much flexibility when you borrow from your\\nbroker to buy and sell securities as you would have if you borrowed from your friendly neighborhood\\nloan shark to play a high-stakes poker game. In other words, not much. Margin loans, which are loans\\nfrom your broker that increase your buying power, are highly regulated, and you must meet the broker's\\nterms. If you fail to repay the loan, your positions will be sold from underneath you. If you try to\\nborrow too much, you will be cut off. No amount of begging and pleading will help you.\\nYour brokerage firm makes you sign a margin agreement, which says that you understand the risks and\\nlimits of your activities. You probably can't have a margin account unless you meet a minimum account\\nsize, maybe $10,000 or more, and the amount you can borrow depends on the size of your account.\\nGenerally, a stock or bond account must hold 50 percent of the purchase price of securities when you\\nborrow the money. The price of those securities can go down, but if they go down so much that the\\naccount ends up holding only 25 percent of the value of the loan, you get a margin call. (Some brokers\\ncall in loans faster than others; their policies are disclosed in their margin agreements.)\\n Brokerage firms handle margin trades all the time. You do the paperwork once, when you sign\\na margin agreement. Then each time you place an order, you're asked whether you're making the\\ntrade with cash or on margin. Click the box marked “Margin,” and you've just borrowed money.\\nIt's that easy.\\nUnderstanding the costs and fees of margin\\nEvery brokerage firm charges interest on margin. The stated number is usually an annualized rate; if the\\nrate given is 8 percent, for example, then you'd owe that much if your loan was outstanding for the\\nentire year. (Some investors have margin loans in place that long.) A day trader, whose loan may only\\nbe outstanding for a few hours, probably has to pay interest, too. Some brokerage firms charge by the\\nday; others may charge interest over three days because it takes three days for a trade to settle.\\n On top of margin interest, some firms charge a higher commission on margin trades than for\\ncash trades. They justify this policy with the higher levels of paperwork and risk management\\nrequired on margin accounts. Some firms go with the higher commission rather than charge\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 127}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"128interest on intraday loans. Your trading life will be easier if you find out your firm's policies and\\nfees before you open a margin account.\\nIf you trade derivatives, margin works differently. The contract itself is leveraged, so you aren't charged\\ninterest. You have to settle your profits and losses at the end of the day, however (don't worry; the\\nexchange's clearinghouse does it for you). You can't use the money held as margin for other trades.\\nManaging margin calls\\nIf the value of your account starts falling and it looks like it's falling below the 25 percent maintenance\\nmargin limit, you get a margin call, in which your broker calls you and asks you to deposit more money\\nin your account. If you can't make the necessary deposit, the broker starts selling your securities to close\\nout the loan. And if you don't have enough to pay off the loan, the broker closes your account and puts a\\nlien, which is a claim on your assets, against you.\\n Most brokerage firms have risk-management limits in place, so you'll probably get plenty of\\nwarning before you get a margin call or see your account closed out. After all, neither you nor\\nyour brokerage firm wants to lose money. Just keep in mind that a margin call is a possibility. If\\nyour account falls to the maintenance level, ask yourself, as objectively as you can, whether your\\nidea is still good or whether you're just wishing and hoping that it is.\\nAt least one brokerage firm advertises that, as a service to you, it will close out your account as soon as\\nyou lose the amount in it in order to keep you from losing more money. This service helps the brokerage\\nfirm as much as it helps you, because it keeps the firm from dealing with the hassles of chasing down\\nadditional margin. This is one example of the built-in risk management policies that firms use to limit\\nrisks to everyone.\\nEnjoying margin bargains for day traders\\nDay traders are often able to avoid margin calls because they borrow money for such short periods of\\ntime. Good day traders look for small market moves and cut their losses early, which minimizes the risk\\nof using other people's money. And by definition, day traders close out their positions every night.\\nIf you qualify as a pattern day trader, you get two benefits. First, your brokerage firm probably won't\\ncharge you any interest as long as you don't hold a margin loan balance overnight. Second, you may be\\nallowed to borrow more than 50 percent of the purchase price of securities. Some firms allow pattern\\nday traders to borrow 75 percent or more of their trade value.\\n The Financial Industries Regulatory Association defines a pattern day trader as one with a\\nmargin account holding at least $25,000. This trader must also buy then sell, or sell short then buy,\\nthe same security on the same day four or more times in five business days. The number of day\\ntrades should be more than 6 percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day\\nperiod.\\nThe Switch-Up of Short Selling\\nTraditionally, investors and traders want to buy low and sell high. They buy a position in a security and\\nthen wait for the price to go up. This strategy isn't a bad way to make money, especially because, if the\\ncountry's economy continues to grow even a little bit, businesses are going to grow and so are their\\nstocks.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 128}),\n",

The company may be mismanaged, it may sell a\\nproduct that's out of favor, or maybe it's just having a string of bad days. For that matter, maybe it went\\nup a little too much in price, and investors are now coming to their senses. In these situations, you can't\\nmake money buying low and selling high. Instead, you need a way to reverse the situation.\\nThe solution? Selling short. In short — hah! — selling short means that you borrow a security and sell\\nit in hopes of repaying the loan of the shares by buying back cheaper shares later on.\\n In trading lingo, when you own something, you are considered to be long. When you sell it,\\nespecially if you do not already own it, you are considered to be short. You don't have to be long\\nbefore you go short.\\nSelling short\\nMost brokerage firms make selling short easy. You simply place an order to sell the stock, and the\\nbroker asks whether you're selling shares that you own or selling short. After you place the order, the\\nbrokerage firm goes about borrowing shares for you to sell. It loans the shares to your account and\\nexecutes the sell order.\\n You can't sell short unless the brokerage firm is able to borrow the shares. Sometimes so many\\npeople have sold a stock short that no shares are left to borrow. In that case, you have to find\\nanother stock or another strategy.\\nWhen the shares are sold, you wait until the security goes down in price, and then you buy the shares in\\nthe market at a bargain. You then return these purchased shares to the broker to pay the loan, and you\\nkeep the difference between where you sold and where you bought — less interest, of course.\\n The stock exchanges are in the business of helping companies raise money, so they have rules\\nin place to help maintain an upward bias in the stock market. These rules can work against the\\nshort seller. The key regulation is what's called the uptick rule, which means you can only sell a\\nstock short when the last trade was a move up. You can't short a stock that's moving down.\\nFigure 9-1 shows how short selling works. The trader borrows 400 shares selling at $25 each and then\\nsells them. If the stock goes down, she can buy back the shares at the lower price, making a tidy profit.\\nIf the stock stays flat, she loses money because the broker will charge her interest based on the value of\\nthe shares she borrowed. And if the stock price goes up, she not only loses money on the interest\\nexpense but also is out on her investment.\\nFigure 9-1:  Looking at short selling in the equities market.\\n The interest and fees that the broker charges traders who borrow stock accrue to the broker, not\\nto the person who actually owns the stock.

Investors who\\nwork the short side of the market spend hours doing careful accounting research, looking for companies\\nthat are likely to go down in price some day.\\nDay traders don't care about accounting. They don't have the time to wait for a short to work out.\\nInstead, they look for stocks that go down in price for more mundane reasons, like more sellers than\\nbuyers in the next ten minutes. Most day traders who sell short simply reverse their long strategy. For\\nexample, some day traders like to buy stocks that have gone down for three days in a row, figuring that\\nthey'll go up on the fourth day. They'll also short stocks that have gone up three days in a row, figuring\\nthat they'll go down on the fourth day. You don't need a CPA to do that!\\nTrading strategies are covered in more detail in Chapters 7 and 8, if you are looking for some ideas.\\nLosing your shorts?\\nShorting stocks carries certain risks because a short sale is a bet on things going wrong. Because, in\\ntheory, there's no limit on how much a stock can go up, there's no limit on how much money a short\\nseller can lose. Two traps in particular can get a short seller. The first is a short squeeze due to good\\nnews; the second is a concerted effort to hurt traders who are short.\\nSqueeze my shorts\\nWith a short squeeze, a company that has been popular with a lot of short sellers has some good news\\nthat drives the stock price up. Or, maybe some other buyers simply drive up the price in order to force\\nthe shorts to sell, which is a common form of market manipulation. When the price goes up, short\\nsellers lose money, and some may even have margin problems. And the original reason for going short\\nmay be proven to be wrong. Those who are short start buying the stock back to reduce their losses, but\\ntheir increased demand drives the stock price even higher, causing even bigger losses for people who\\nare still short. Ouch!\\nCalling back the stock\\nAll is not sweetness and light in the world of short selling. Many market participants distrust those folks\\nwho are doing all the careful research, in part because they are often right. Company executives are\\noften optimists who don't like to hear bad news, and they blame short sellers for all that is wrong with\\ntheir stock price. Meanwhile, some short sellers have been known to get impatient and start spreading\\nugly rumors if their sale isn't making money.\\nMany companies, brokers, and investors hate short sellers and try tactics to bust them. Sometimes they\\nissue good news or spread rumors of good news to create a squeeze. Other times, they collectively ask\\nholders of the stock to request that their brokerage firm not loan out their shares, which means that those\\nwho shorted the stock have to buy back and return the shares even if doing so makes no sense.\\nLeveraging All Kinds of Accounts\\nLeverage is the use of borrowed money to increase returns. Day traders use leverage a lot to get bigger\\nreturns from relatively small price changes in the underlying securities. And as long as they consistently\\nclose their positions out at the end of the day, day traders can borrow more money and pay less interest\\nthan people who hold securities for a longer term.\\nThe process of borrowing works differently in different markets. In the stock and bond markets, it's\\nstraightforward: When you place the order, you just tell your broker you're borrowing. In the options\\nand futures markets, the contracts you buy and sell have leverage built in to them. Although you don't\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 130}),\n",

Then when the security goes up in\\nprice, you get a greater percentage return because you've been able to buy more for your money. Of\\ncourse, that also increases your potential losses. (For more detail on the margin process, head to the\\nearlier section “The Magic of Margin.”)\\nFigure 9-2 shows how leverage works. The trader borrows money to buy 400 shares of SuperCorp. If\\nthe stock goes up 4 percent, she makes 8 percent. Whoo-hooo! But if the stock goes down 4 percent, she\\nstill has to repay the loan at full dollar value, so she ends up losing 8 percent. That's not so good.\\nFigure 9-2:  An example of trading stocks on margin.\\n If you hold your margin position overnight or longer, you have to start paying interest, which\\ncuts into your returns or increases your losses.\\nIn options markets\\nAn option gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock or other item at a set price\\nwhen the contract expires. A call option gives you the right to buy, so you would buy a call if you think\\nthe underlying asset is going up. A put option gives you the right to sell, so you would buy a put if you\\nthink the underlying asset is going down. (You can read more about options in Chapter 3.) By trading an\\noption, you get exposure to changes in the price of the underlying security without actually buying the\\nsecurity itself. That's the source of the leverage in the market.\\nA day trader can use options to get an exposure to price changes in a stock for a lot less money than\\nbuying the stock itself would cost. Suppose a call option is deeply in the money, meaning that its strike\\nprice (the price at which you would buy the stock if you exercised the option) is far below the current\\nstock price. In this event, the obvious thing to do is to set option price at the difference between the\\ncurrent stock price and the strike price, which is more or less what happens — more in theory, less in\\npractice. When the stock price changes, the option price changes by almost exactly the same amount,\\nenabling you to buy the price performance of the stock at a discount, with the discount being the strike\\nprice of the option.\\nFigure 9-3 shows the performance-boosting leverage from this strategy. The trader buys call options\\nwith an exercise price of $10 on a stock trading at $25. The option price changes the same amount that\\nthe stock price does, but the call holder gets a greater percentage return than the stockholder.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 131}),\n",

The appendix has some resources to help you in your research.\\nIn futures trading\\nA futures contract gives you the obligation to buy or sell an underlying financial or agricultural\\ncommodity, assuming you still hold the contract at the expiration date. That underlying product ranges\\nfrom the value of treasury bonds to barrels of oil and heads of cattle, and you're only putting money\\ndown now when you purchase the contract. You don't have to come up with the full amount until the\\ncontract comes due — and almost all options and futures traders close out their trades long before the\\ncontract expiration date. Futures are discussed in Chapter 3, but here I talk about how leverage works in\\nthe futures market.\\n Although most options and futures contracts settle with cash long before the due date, contract\\nholders have the right to hold them until the due date and, in the case of options on common stock\\nand agricultural derivatives, demand physical delivery. It's rare, but the commodity exchanges\\nhave systems in place for determining the transport, specifications, and delivery of grain, cattle, or\\nethanol. One advantage of day trading is that you close out the same day, without ever even\\nthinking about the fine print of physical delivery.\\nBecause derivatives have built-in leverage that allows a trader to have big market exposure for\\nrelatively few dollars up front, they've become popular with day traders. Figure 9-4 shows how\\nderivative leverage works. Here, a trader is buying the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's E-mini S&P 500\\nfutures contract, which gives her exposure to the performance of the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, a\\nstandard measure of the stock performance of a diversified list of 500 large American companies. The\\nfutures contract trades at 50 times the value of the index, rounded to the nearest $0.25. The minimum\\nmargin that this trader must put down on the contract is $3,500. Each $0.25 change in the index leads to\\na $12.50 ($0.25 × 50) change in the value of the contract, and that $12.50 is added to or subtracted from\\nthe $3,500 margin.\\nFigure 9-4:  Margin and the derivatives trade with built-in leverage.\\n Some exchanges use the term margin, and others prefer to use performance bond. Either term\\nrefers to the same thing: money you put in up front to ensure that you can meet the contract terms\\nwhen it comes due. If you hold the contract overnight, your account is adjusted up or down to\\nreflect the day's profits. If it gets too low, you're asked to add more money.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 132}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"133In foreign exchange\\nThe foreign exchange, or forex, market is driven by leverage. Despite the nervous reports you may hear\\nin the financial news, exchange rates tend to move slowly, by as little as a tenth or even a hundredth of a\\npenny a day. And the markets are so huge that hedging risk is easier in the currency markets than in\\nother financial markets. You may have trouble borrowing shares of stock that you want to short, but you\\nshould have no trouble ever borrowing yen. To get a big return, forex traders almost always borrow\\nhuge amounts of money.\\nIn the stock market, day traders can borrow up to three times the amount of cash and securities held in\\ntheir accounts (although not all firms let you borrow the statutory maximum), and that amount is set by\\noutside regulatory organizations. In the forex market, there is no regulation on lending, and some forex\\nfirms allow traders to borrow as much as 400 times the amount in their accounts.\\nForex firms allow such huge borrowing because they can hedge their risks so that if you lose money,\\nthey make money. If you sell dollars to buy euros, for example, the firm can easily go in and sell euros\\nto buy dollars. This capability makes its position net neutral. If the euro goes down relative to the dollar,\\nyou lose money, but the firm can offset its risk because its counter-trade went up.\\n The reason that a forex firm hedges its risks against its day-trading customers is that most day\\ntraders lose money. The firm knows that if it bets against the aggregate trades held by its\\ncustomers, it'll probably come out ahead. Don't trade in forex or any other market until you've\\nworked out a strategy and practiced it so that you can avoid becoming a statistic. Chapter 16 has\\ninformation on testing and evaluating trading strategies.\\nFigure 9-5 shows how leverage in foreign exchange makes good returns possible. Here, the trader starts\\nwith a $1,000 account and borrows the maximum amount the forex firms allow, $400 for each dollar in\\nthe account. All $401,000 are put to work buying euros. Note that the euro value stays constant, but the\\ndollar value of those euros changes by hundredths of a penny. Thanks to leverage, the return is 11\\npercent — not bad for a day's trading! Of course, you could lose 11 percent, which wouldn't be so good.\\nFigure 9-5:  Trading foreign exchange on margin.\\n An exchange rate is just the price of money.

One way to do so is to have another source of income —\\nfrom savings, a spouse, or a job that doesn't overlap with market hours. Other day traders take money\\nout of their trading account.\\nIf the market hasn't been cooperative, your account may not have enough in it to allow you to withdraw\\nfunds while still maintaining enough capital to trade. One option is to arrange a margin loan through a\\nbrokerage firm. With a margin loan, the firm lets you take out a loan against the cash in your account\\n(or securities that you are holding, not trading). You can spend the money any way you like, but you're\\ncharged interest and you have to repay it. Still, a margin loan is a good option to know about because\\nday-trade earnings tend to be erratic.\\nBorrowing for trading capital\\nSome day traders use a double layer of leverage: They borrow the money to set up their trading\\naccounts and then they borrow money for their trading strategies. If the market cooperates, this type of\\nborrowing can be a great way to make money, but if the market doesn't cooperate, you could end up\\nowing a lot of people money that you don't have.\\nIf you want to take the risk, though, you have a few resources to turn to other than your relatives: You\\ncan borrow against your house, use your credit cards, or find a trading firm that will give you some\\nmoney to work with.\\nBorrowing against your house\\nYes, you can use a mortgage or a home equity line of credit to get the money for your day-trading\\nactivities. In general, this option carries low interest rates because your house is your collateral. In most\\ncases, however, the interest isn't tax deductible (ask your accountant, but generally, you can only deduct\\ninterest used to purchase or improve your house). Still, borrowing against your house can be a relatively\\nlow-cost way to pull value stored in your house for use in trading.\\n The risk? If you can't pay back the loan, you can lose your residence. If you decide to pursue\\nthis strategy, just don't borrow against your car, too, because you'll need a place to live when the\\nbank forecloses.\\nPutting it on the card\\nThe business world is filled with people who started businesses using credit cards.

If the only way you can raise the\\ncapital for day trading is through your credit card, consider waiting a few years and saving your\\nmoney before taking the plunge.

This is known as free riding, and the SEC doesn't look kindly\\nupon it. In fact, brokerage firms are required to freeze a customer's account for 90 days when they\\nidentify free riding. The customer can then trade only if he or she pays for each trade as it is made rather\\nthan receiving the three days normally allowed.\\nIf you're trading in a cash account, you can avoid a free-riding freezeout by paying for any securities\\nthat you buy within three days, without relying on money from the sale of those securities to cover the\\npayment. The alternative is to trade in a margin account.\\nAssessing Risks and Returns from Short Selling\\nand Leverage\\nLeverage introduces risk to your day trading, and that can give you greatly increased returns. Most day\\ntraders use leverage, at least part of the time, to make their trading activities pay off in cold, hard cash.\\nThe challenge is to use leverage responsibly. Chapter 6 goes into money management in great detail, but\\nhere I cover the two issues most related to leverage: losing your money and losing your nerve.\\nUnderstanding those risks can help you determine how much leverage you should take and how often\\nyou can take it.\\nLosing your money\\nLosing money is an obvious hazard. Leverage magnifies your returns, but it also magnifies your risks.\\nAny borrowings have to be repaid regardless. If you buy or sell a futures or options contract, you are\\nlegally obligated to perform, even if you have lost money. That can be really hard.\\n Day trading is risky in large part because of the amount of leverage used. If you don't feel\\ncomfortable with that, you may want to use little or no leverage, especially when you are new to\\nday trading or when you are starting to work a new trading strategy.\\nLosing your nerve\\nThe basic risk and return of your underlying strategy isn't affected by leverage. If you expect that your\\nsystem will work about 60 percent of the time, that should hold no matter how much money is at stake\\nor where that money came from. However, trading with borrowed money likely does make a difference\\nto you on some subconscious level.\\n Trading is very much a game of nerves. If you hesitate to make a trade, cut a loss, or otherwise\\nfollow your strategy, you're going to run into trouble. Say you're trading futures and decide that\\nyou'll accept three downticks before selling and that you'll look for five upticks before selling.\\nThis strategy means you're willing to accept some loss, cut it if it gets out of hand, and then be\\ndisciplined about taking gains when you get them. It keeps a lid on your losses while forcing some\\ndiscipline on your gains. Now, suppose you're dealing with lots and lots of leverage. Suddenly,\\nthose downticks become too real to you — it's money you don't have. Next thing you know, you\\nonly accept two downticks before closing out. But doing so keeps you from getting winners.

Arbitrage is a trading\\nstrategy that looks to make profits from small discrepancies in securities prices. The idea is that the\\narbitrageur, or arb (the person who does arbitrage), works back and forth among the prices in the\\nmarket to reach one final level. In theory, arbitrage is riskless. It's illogical for the same asset to trade at\\ndifferent prices, so eventually the two prices must converge. The person who buys at the lower price\\nand sells at the higher one makes money with no risk.\\nGood arbitrageurs have a paradoxical mix of patience (to wait for the right opportunity) and impatience\\n(to place the trade the instant the opportunity appears). If you have the fortitude to watch the market or\\nare willing to have software do it for you (see information on research services in Chapter 13), you'll\\nprobably find enough good arbitrage opportunities to keep you busy.\\nTrue arbitrage involves buying and selling the same security, often with high levels of leverage\\n(borrowing — see Chapter 9) to boost returns. Other traders follow trading strategies involving similar,\\nbut not identical, securities. These fall under the category of risk arbitrage. Because brokerage firms,\\nhedge funds, and other institutions have a huge advantage over day traders, day traders are more likely\\nto rely on risk arbitrage than on other forms.\\nIn this chapter, I cover the terms and strategies that day traders who engage in arbitrage use, discuss the\\nbasics of arbitrage and how a patient trader can put those to good use, outline the tools you can use to\\nprofit from price differences among similar securities, and list the many types of arbitrage you may\\nwant to include in your arsenal of trading strategies.\\nThe challenge is that everyone is looking for these easy profits, so there may not be many of them out\\nthere.\\nArbitrage and the Law of One Price\\nThe key to success in any investment is buying low and selling high.

For everyone\\nelse, especially day traders, what you see is what you get.\\nUnder the law of one price, the same asset has the same value everywhere. If markets allow for easy\\ntrading — and the financial markets certainly do — then any price discrepancies are short-lived because\\ntraders immediately step in to buy at the low price and sell at the high price. In the following sections I\\nexplore how market efficiency limits arbitrage opportunities and how you can step in when the moment\\nis right.\\nUnderstanding how arbitrage and market efficiency interact\\n The law of one price holds as long as markets are efficient. Market efficiency is a controversial\\ntopic in finance. In academic theory, markets are perfectly efficient, and arbitrage simply isn't\\npossible. That makes a lot of sense if you are testing different assumptions about how the markets\\nwould work in a perfect world. A long-term investor would say that markets are inefficient in the\\nshort run but perfectly efficient in the long run, so they believe that if they do their research now,\\nthe rest of the world will eventually come around, allowing them to make good money.\\nTraders are in between. The market price and volume are pretty much all the information they have to\\ngo on. The price may be irrational, but that doesn't matter today. The only thing a trader wants to know\\nis whether an opportunity exists to make money given what's going on right now.\\nIn the academic world, market efficiency comes in three flavors, with no form allowing for arbitrage:\\nStrong form: Everything, even inside information known only to company executives, is reflected\\nin the security's price.\\nSemi-strong form: Prices include all public information, so profiting from insider trading may be\\npossible.\\nWeak-form: Prices reflect all historical information, so research that uncovers new trends may be\\nbeneficial.\\nThose efficient-market true believers are convinced that arbitrage is imaginary because someone\\nwould've noticed a price difference between markets already and immediately acted to close it off. But\\nwho are those mysterious someones? They are day traders! Even the most devout efficient markets\\nadherent would, if pressed, admit that day traders perform a valuable service in the name of market\\nefficiency. The 2008 financial crisis and the 2010 flash crash thinned the ranks of the efficient-market\\ntrue believers.\\nThose with a less-rigid view of market activity admit that arbitrage opportunities exist but that they are\\nfew and far between. A trader who expects to make money from arbitrage had better pay close attention\\nto the markets to act quickly when a moment happens.\\nFinally, people who don't believe in market efficiency believe that market prices are usually out of sync\\nwith asset values. They do research in hopes of learning things that other people don't know. This\\nmindset favors investors more than traders because it can take time for these price discrepancies to work\\nthemselves out.\\n Because arbitrage requires traders to work fast, it tends to work best for traders who are willing\\nand able to automate their trading. If you are comfortable with programming and relying on\\nsoftware to do your work, arbitrage may be a great strategy for you.

Suppose that\\nwhat you see in New York is not what you see in London, or that you notice that futures prices are not\\ntracking movements in the underlying asset. How about if you see that the stock of every company\\nexcept one in an industry has reacted to a news event?\\nWell, then, you have an opportunity to make money, but you'd better act fast because other people will\\nprobably see the discrepancy, too. What you do is simple: You sell as much of the high-priced asset in\\nthe high-priced market as you can, borrowing shares if you need to, and then you immediately turn\\naround and buy the low-priced asset in the low-priced market.\\n Think of the markets as a scale, and you, the arbitrageur, must bring fairness to them. When the\\nmarkets are out of balance, you take from the high-priced market (the heavier side of the scale)\\nand return it to the low-priced market (the lighter side) until both even out at a price in between.\\nIf you start with a high price of $8 and a low price of $6 and then buy at $6 and sell at $8, your\\nmaximum profit is $2 — with no risk. Until the point where the two assets balance at $7, you can make\\na profit on the difference between them.\\nOf course, most price differences are on the order of pennies, not dollars, but if you can find enough of\\nthese little pricing errors and trade them in size, you can make good money.\\n Sometimes, the price differences are less than a penny, a situation the traders call subpennying.\\nA day trader really can't work with that. To see if subpennying is going on with an asset that you\\ntrade, set your price screens to display four decimal places rather than only two.\\nReducing arbitrage opportunities: High-frequency trading\\nMost of the large brokerage firms and many large hedge funds have invested crazy amounts of time and\\nmoney to develop high-frequency and algorithmic trading strategies. These strategies use computer\\nprograms that control billions of dollars and make extremely short-term trades — sometimes holding\\nonly for seconds — whenever the programs spot short-term discrepancies in the market. In some ways,\\nthis practice has made the market more efficient, because these program traders fix prices that are out of\\nwhack in no time. But they have also added to volatility, sometimes due to program glitches and\\nsometimes because the trades go on even when they shouldn't, because no human is there to stop them.\\nIn fact, many observers of the market microstructure, which is the underlying trading environment,\\nthink that the amount of high-frequency and algorithmic trading has reduced efficiency. They see\\nevidence that the larger number of market participants have led to knee-jerk reactions when different\\nprograms malfunction or entire systems fail. The downside for the day trader is that these programs\\nhave eliminated many arbitrage opportunities that once made up the bread and butter of many a trader's\\nearnings.\\nScalping, the Dangerous Game\\nThe law of one price is all well and good, but prices change constantly during the day. They go up a\\nlittle bit, they go down a little bit, and they move every time an order is placed.\\nOnce upon a time, day traders could profit from these movements. The process, known as scalping, is\\nnot exactly arbitrage. Especially active in commodities markets, scalpers look to take advantage of\\nchanges in a security's bid-ask spread. This spread is the difference between the price that a broker will\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 139}),\n",

After all, under market efficiency, everyone has the same\\ninformation, so their trading is consistent and allows the broker-dealers to generate a steady profit.\\nSometimes, however, the spread is a little wider or narrower than normal, not because of a change in the\\ninformation in the market but because of short-term imbalances in supply and demand.\\nA basic scalping strategy looks like this:\\nIf the spread between the bid and the ask is wider than usual, the ask is higher and the bid is\\nlower than it should be. That's because slightly more people want to buy than to sell, so the brokers\\ncharge the buyers higher prices. The scalper uses this as a sign to sell.\\nIf the spread between the bid and the ask is narrower than usual, the ask is lower and the bid is\\nhigher than it would normally be. This situation occurs when sellers slightly outnumber buyers and\\nthe broker wants to find buyers to pick up the slack. The scalper would be in there buying — and\\nhoping that the selling pressure is short lived.\\nThe scalper has to work quickly to make many small trades. He may buy at $20.25, sell at $20.50, and\\nbuy again at $20.30. He has to have a low trade cost structure in place (discussed later in this chapter)\\nor else he'll pay out all his profits and more to the broker. He also has to be sure that the price changes\\naren't driven by real information, because that makes market prices too volatile to make scalping\\nprofitable. Scalping is akin to “picking up nickels in front of a steamroller,” some traders say, because\\nof the risk of focusing on small price changes when bigger changes are underway.\\n For years, scalping was a common day-trading strategy. It was always tricky business, given\\nhow quickly prices could move within a trend. With the presence of so many high-frequency\\ntraders, scalping has become downright dangerous, if not impossible. High-frequency traders can\\nand will move before you can. Nowadays, scalping is like picking up pennies as steamrollers\\ncome at you from all sides.\\n Scalping, as defined here, is perfectly legal. However, the word is also used to describe some\\nillegal activities, such as promoting a security in public and then selling it in private. (Another\\nterm for this is pump and dump.) If a celebrity goes on his Twitter feed and talks about how great\\na stock is so that the price goes up and then he sells the stock the next day when everyone else is\\nbuying, he has committed the crime of scalping.\\nThose Pesky T ransaction Costs\\nPure arbitrage works best in a world where trading is free. In reality, trading costs good money.\\nSometimes you may notice a price discrepancy that seems to last forever, but you can't work it because\\nthe profit wouldn't cover your costs. And that actually may be true for everyone else out there.\\nIn the real world, trading costs money. Consider all the costs of getting started: buying equipment,\\npaying for Internet access, learning how to trade.

Then don't get so fixated on covering your costs that you avoid\\nexiting trades at the right time.\\nRisk Arbitrage and Its T ools\\nIn its purest form, arbitrage is riskless because the purchase of an asset in one market and the sale of the\\nasset in another happen simultaneously — you just let those profits flow right into your account. This\\nsituation does occur, but not often, and not in a way that lets most day traders compete with algorithmic\\ntraders.\\nBecause so few opportunities for true arbitrage exist, most day traders looking at arbitrage strategies\\nactually practice risk arbitrage. Like true arbitrage, risk arbitrage attempts to generate profits from price\\ndiscrepancies, but like the name implies, risk arbitrage involves taking some risk. Yes, you buy one\\nsecurity and sell another in risk arbitrage, but it's not always the same security and not always at the\\nsame time. For example, a day trader may buy the stock of an acquisition target and sell the stock of an\\nacquirer in the hopes of making a profit as the deal nears the closing date.\\n Risk arbitrage usually involves strategies that unfold over time — possibly hours, but usually\\ndays or weeks. Pursuing these strategies puts you into the world of swing trading (described in\\nChapter 2), which carries a different set of risks than day trading.\\nIn risk arbitrage, a trader is buying and selling similar securities. Much of the risk draws from the fact\\nthat the securities are not identical, so the law of one price isn't absolute. Nevertheless, it forms the\\nguiding principle, which is this: If you have two different ways to buy the same thing, then the prices of\\neach purchase should be proportional. If the prices aren't proportional, there's an opportunity to make\\nmoney. And what day trader doesn't want to make money?\\n Return is a function of risk.

       " Document(page_content=\"142Arbitrageurs use a mix of different assets and techniques to create these different ways of buying the\\nsame thing. The following sections describe some of their favorites.\\nArbitrating derivatives\\nDerivatives are options, futures, and related financial contracts that draw or derive their value from the\\nvalue of something else, such as the price of a stock index or the current cost of corn. Derivatives offer a\\nlower-cost, lower-obligation method of getting exposure to certain price changes. In the case of\\nagricultural and energy commodities, derivatives are the only practical way for a day trader to own\\nthem. Because they are so closely tied to the value of the underlying security, derivatives form a useful,\\nalmost-but-not-quite asset for traders looking for arbitrage situations. A trader may see a price\\ndiscrepancy between the derivative and the underlying asset, thus noticing a profitable trading\\nopportunity.\\nUsing a derivative in tandem with its underlying security, traders can construct a range of risk arbitrage\\ntrades (and you can read more about them later in this section). For example, a trader looking to set up\\narbitrage on a merger could trade options on the stocks of the buying and selling companies rather than\\ntrading the stocks themselves. The more arbitrage opportunities there are, the greater the likelihood of\\nmaking a low-risk profit.\\nLevering with leverage\\nLeverage is the process of borrowing money to trade in order to increase potential returns. The more\\nmoney the trader borrows, the greater the return on capital that she can earn. Leverage is commonly\\nused by day traders, because most trades with a one-day time horizon carry low returns unless they are\\nmagnified through borrowing. (Go to Chapter 9 for detailed coverage of leverage.)\\nThat magic of magnification becomes especially important in arbitrage, because the price discrepancies\\nbetween securities tend to be really small. The primary way to get a bigger return is to borrow money to\\ndo it.\\n Leverage has a downside: Along with improving returns, it increases risk. Because even risk\\narbitrage strategies tend to have low risk, the risk associated with leverage may be acceptable. Just\\nremember that you have to repay all borrowed money, no matter what happens to prices. Chapter\\n9 has more information on that.\\nShort selling\\nShort selling (another topic from Chapter 9) creates another set of alternatives for setting up an arbitrage\\ntrade — one that's almost necessary to the process. Short selling allows a day trader to profit when a\\nsecurity's price goes down. The short seller goes to her broker, borrows the security that she thinks will\\ndecline in price, sells it, and then buys it back in the market later so that she has the shares to repay the\\nloan. In essence, the trader is selling high (with borrowed money) and buying back low. Assuming she's\\nright and the price does indeed fall, she pockets the difference between the price where she sold the\\nsecurity and the price where she bought it back. Of course, that difference is her loss if the price goes up\\ninstead of down. The arbitrageur can use this to bet on assets that are likely to go down in price when\\nanother asset goes up.\\nBy adding short selling to the bag of tricks, an arbitrageur can find a lot more ways to profit from a\\nprice discrepancy in the market. New combinations of cheap and expensive assets — and more ways to\\ntrade them — give a day trader more opportunities to make trades during the day.\\nCreating synthetic securities\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 142}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"143Feeling creative? Well, then, consider creating synthetic securities when looking for arbitrage\\nopportunities. A synthetic security is a combination of assets that have the same profit-and-loss profile\\nas another asset or group of assets. For example, a stock is a combination of a short put option, which\\nhas value if the stock goes down in price, and a long call option, which has value if the stock goes up in\\nprice. By thinking up ways to mimic the behavior of an asset through a synthetic security, a day trader\\ncan find more ways for an asset to be cheaper in one market than in another, leading to more potential\\narbitrage opportunities.\\nA typical arbitrage transaction involving a synthetic security, for example, involves shorting the real\\nsecurity and then buying a package of derivatives that match its risk and return. Many of the risk-\\narbitrage techniques covered later in this chapter involve the creation of synthetic securities.\\n Complex arbitrage trading strategies require more testing and simulation trading (covered in\\nChapter 16) and may possibly involve losses while you fine-tune your methods. Be sure you feel\\ncomfortable with your trading method before you commit big time and big dollars to it.\\nArbitrage Strategies for Day T raders\\nYou can use the tools of arbitrage — derivatives, leverage, short selling, synthetic securities — in all\\nsorts of ways to generate potentially profitable trades, and that's what this section of the chapter covers.\\nIf you decide to do arbitrage, you may discover a few useful strategies to follow. Beware of picking too\\nmany: The trader who tries to do too much is the trader who will soon be looking for a new job! Instead,\\nlook for an arbitrage strategy that matches your approach to the market and make it your own.\\nThe varieties of arbitrage transactions are listed here in alphabetical order. Some are more complex than\\nothers, some generate more opportunities than others, and some work best if you are willing to swing\\ntrade (hold for a few days) rather than day trade (close out all positions at the end of the day). Keep in\\nmind that this list is not exhaustive; you can find plenty of other ways to exploit price differences in the\\nmarket, but some involve more time than a day trader is willing to commit.\\n Many arbitrage strategies work best in combination with other strategies, such as news-driven\\ntrading (discussed in Chapter 8). For example, a news announcement may cause people to pay\\nattention to a company's stock, resulting in enough trading activity that day to close a price gap. If\\nyou know about the pricing problem ahead of time, you can swoop in and make the arbitrage that\\nday.\\nOther types of arbitrage are certainly out there. Wherever people pay close attention to the markets and\\nprice changes, they find small price differences to turn into large, low-risk profits. If you think you've\\nfound an arbitrage strategy not listed here, by all means, go and test it to see whether it will work for\\nyou.\\nConvertible arbitrage\\nAs part of designing their capital structure, some companies issue convertible bonds (sometimes called\\na convertible debenture) or convertible preferred stock. These securities are a cross between stocks and\\nbonds. Like an ordinary bond, convertibles pay regular income to those who hold them (interest for\\nconvertible bonds and dividends for convertible preferred stock), but they also act a little like stock\\nbecause the holders have the right to exchange the convertible security for ordinary common stock.\\nHere's an example: A $1,000 convertible bond pays 7.5 percent interest and is convertible into 25 shares\\nof stock. If the stock is less than $40 per share, the convertible holder will prefer to cash the interest or\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 143}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"144dividend checks. If the company's stock trades above $40, the convertible holder would make more\\nmoney giving up the income in order to get the stock cheap. Because of the benefit of conversion, the\\ninterest rate on a convertible security is usually below that on a regular corporate bond.\\n Because a convertible security carries a built-in option to buy the underlying stock, it generally\\ntrades in line with the stock. If the convertible's price gets too high or too low, then an arbitrage\\nopportunity presents itself.\\nConsider this case: A day trader notices that a convertible bond is selling at a lower price than it should\\nbe, given the current level of interest rates and the price of the company's common stock. So he buys the\\nconvertibles and sells the common stock short (see Chapter 9 for more on short selling). When the\\nstock's price moves back into line, he collects a profit from both sides of the trade.\\nETF arbitrage\\nAn exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a security based on a stock market index. It may be a recognized\\nindex or one that has been invented by the company that created the ETF to track a particular\\ninvestment strategy.\\nETFs have been designed with a built-in mechanism to keep the price of the funds in line with the\\nunderlying securities. A typical ETF has two classes of shareholders. The first are authorized\\nparticipants, which are large trading firms that agree to buy the securities in the ETF. The authorized\\nparticipants then give the securities to the ETF company in exchange for creation units, which are\\nshares of the fund that the authorized participant can hold, sell on the open market, or trade back to the\\nETF company for the shares. The authorized participant will do whatever had the greatest profit\\npotential, some built-in arbitrage designed to keep the ETF's value in line for the second class of\\nshareholders, the regular ETF traders.\\nDespite this mechanism, an ETF's value may swing out of line with the underlying index or the\\nunderlying fundamentals of the sector that it represents. When this happens, a trader can look for an\\narbitrage opportunity between the ETF and an index future, between two different ETFs, or between an\\nETF and a representative stock.\\nFixed income and interest-rate arbitrage\\nFixed-income securities are bonds, notes, and related securities that give their owners a regular interest\\npayment. They are popular with conservative investors, especially retirees, who want to generate a\\nregular income from the quarterly interest payments. They are considered to be safe, predictable, long-\\nrun investments, but they can fluctuate wildly in the short term, which makes them attractive to\\narbitrageurs.\\nInterest rates are the price of money, and so they affect the value of many kinds of securities. Fixed-\\nincome securities have a great deal of interest-rate exposure because they pay out interest. Some stocks\\nhave interest-rate exposure, too. Trading in foreign exchange is an attempt to profit from the changing\\nprice of one currency relative to another, and that's usually a function of the difference in interest rates\\nbetween the two countries. Derivatives have a regular expiration schedule, so they have some time\\nvalue, and that's measured through interest rates.\\nWith so many different assets affected by changes in interest rates, arbitrageurs pay attention. With\\nfixed-income arbitrage, the trader breaks out the following:\\nThe time value of money\\nThe level of risk in the economy\\nThe likelihood of repayment\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='145\\nThe inflation-rate effects on different securities\\nIf one of the numbers is out of whack, the trader constructs and executes an arbitrage trade to profit\\nfrom it.\\n Buying bonds outright is rarely practical for a day trader. Instead, day traders looking at fixed-\\nincome arbitrage and other interest-rate sensitive strategies usually rely on interest-rate futures,\\noffered by the CME Group. You can read more about interest-rate futures in Chapter 3.\\nHow would such a trade work? Think of a day trader monitoring interest rates on U.S. government\\nsecurities. He notices that two-year treasury notes are trading at a lower yield than expected —\\nespecially relative to five-year treasury notes. He sells futures on the two-year treasury notes and then\\nbuys futures on the five-year treasury notes. When the difference between the two rates falls back where\\nit should be, the futures trade will turn a profit.\\nIndex arbitrage\\nMarket observers talk a lot about the performance of the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial\\nAverage. These market indexes represent the activity of the market and are widely published for market\\nobservers to follow. The performance of the index is based on the performance of a group of securities,\\nranging from the 3,000 largest companies in the market (the Russell 3,000) to a mere 30 large\\ncompanies (the Dow Jones Industrial Average).\\nSure, an arbitrageur could buy all the stocks, and some hedge funds do just that. But very few people\\ncan afford to pursue that strategy. Instead, they get exposure to index performance through the many\\ndifferent securities based on the indexes. Buy-and-hold mutual fund investors can buy funds that hold\\nall the same stocks in the same proportion as the index. Those with shorter-term profits in mind can buy\\nexchange-traded funds, which are baskets of stocks listed on organized exchanges, or they can trade\\nfutures and options on the indexes.\\nArbitrageurs love the idea of an asset — like an index — that has lots of different securities based on its\\nvalue because it creates lots of opportunities for mispricing. Unless the index, the futures, the options,\\nand the exchange-traded funds are all in line, some canny day trader can step in and make some money.\\nSuppose, for example, that the S&P 500 futures contract is looking mighty cheap relative to the price of\\nthe S&P 500 Index. A trader can short an exchange-traded fund on the index and then buy futures\\ncontracts to profit from the difference.\\nMerger arbitrage\\nEvery day, companies get bought and sold, and that creates arbitrage opportunities. In fact, one of the\\nbetter-known arbitrage strategies out there is merger arbitrage, in which traders try to profit from the\\nchange in stock prices after a merger has been announced. This kind of trade starts with the trader\\nlooking at the following details in the merger announcement:\\nThe name of the acquiring company\\nThe name of the company being taken over (and no matter what PR people say, there are no\\nmergers of equals)\\nThe price of the transaction\\nThe currency (cash, stock, debt)\\nThe date the merger is expected to close', metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 145}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"146Until the date that the merger actually closes, which may be different from the date in the merger\\nannouncement, any and every one of the announced details can change. The acquiring company may\\nlearn new information about the target company and change its mind. A third company may jump in\\nand make an offer for more money. The shareholders may agree to support the deal only if they get cash\\ninstead of stock. All that drama creates opportunity, both for traders looking for one-day opportunities\\nand for those willing to hold a position until the merger closing date.\\nHere's an example. Say that Major Bancorp offers to buy Downtown Bank for $50 per share in cash.\\nMajor Bancorp's shares will probably fall in price because its shareholders will be concerned that the\\nmerger will be a lot of trouble. Downtown Bank's shares will go up in price, but not all the way to $50,\\nbecause its shareholders understand the risk that the deal won't go through. An arbitrageur would short\\nMajor Bancorp and buy Downtown Bank to profit from the concerns. If Overseas Banque decides to\\nstep in, the trader may think it a profitable idea to buy Major Bancorp and short Overseas Banque. (If\\nanother bidder steps in and places a higher offer for Downtown Bank, then the whole arbitrage unravels\\n— hence, the risk.)\\nGarbitrage\\nTraders get sloppy when an exciting merger is announced. If one company in an industry gets taken over,\\nthe stock in all the companies in the industry will go up, often for no good reason. Some traders get so\\ncarried away that they buy the wrong stock entirely, usually because of confusion over ticker symbols. If\\nLowe's Companies, a hardware chain with the ticker symbol LOW, were to be taken over, chances are\\ngood that the stock in Loews Corporation — an insurance company with the ticker symbol L — would also\\ngo up. Such bad trading is known as g a r b it r a g e .\\nOption arbitrage\\nOptions, discussed in detail in Chapter 3, form the basis of many arbitrage strategies, especially for\\nthose day traders who work the stock market. First, many different types of options are available, even\\non the same security. The two main categories are puts, which bet on the underlying security price\\nfalling, and calls, which bet on the underlying security price rising. Puts and calls on the same security\\ncome in many different strike prices, depending on where you want to bet the price goes. Some options,\\nknown as American options, can be cashed in at any time between the date of issue and the expiration\\ndate, and you can exercise others, known as European options, only at the expiration date. (To\\ncomplicate matters, American and European options can be issued anywhere.) With all those choices,\\nthe alert arbitrageur is bound to notice a few price discrepancies.\\nMaybe a day trader notices that on a day when a company has a big announcement, the options\\nexchanges seem to be assuming a slightly higher price for the stock than where the stock is actually\\ntrading. He decides to buy the underlying stock as well as a put; he also sells a call with the same strike\\nprice and expiration date as the put. This strategy creates a synthetic security (refer to the earlier section\\n“Creating synthetic securities”) that has the same payoff as shorting the security, meaning that the trader\\nhas pulled off a riskless arbitrage transaction. He effectively bought the security cheap in the stock\\nmarket and sold it at a higher price in the options market.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 146}),\n",

It's that simple. Although every trader\\nneeds one, and although the rates charged are similar, brokerage accounts are not commodities. Not\\nonly do different brokers offer different services, but most brokers also have tiers of services available\\nfor different types of investors and traders. You aren't just buying a way to execute a trade but rather a\\nset of services.\\nSome brokerage services will be worth the money and then some to you. Others will be inappropriate\\nfor your style.

What kind of broker you need depends on what\\nyou plan to trade (head to Chapter 3 for some of the basics of different types of securities and where\\nthey trade):\\nIf you plan to trade stocks, you need a full-service broker that belongs to NASDAQ, the New York\\nStock Exchange, and other major exchanges.\\nIf you'd rather trade the stock market through the CME Group's E-Mini index futures, or if you're\\ninterested in other types of derivatives, then you need a futures trading account with a broker\\nholding a seat on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or other derivatives exchange.\\n Many day traders pursue two or three strategies, which may require holding different\\nbrokerage accounts. Having multiple brokerage accounts isn't unusual. If you are going to trade\\nboth grain futures and tech stocks, for example, you may want one account with a futures\\nbrokerage that belongs to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and another account with a stock\\nbrokerage that offers fast execution.\\nThe following sections tell you what to look for when choosing a brokerage firm.\\nGetting proper pricing\\nAll brokerage firms offer price quotes: a summary of the current bid and offer prices for selling or\\nbuying the security in question.

Others are\\ndelayed, sometimes by seconds, sometimes by minutes.

Direct-\\naccess brokers allow you to see the price quotes in real time so that you can act on them\\nimmediately, and they allow you to work through different electronic communications networks\\nrather than going through the firm's own traders.\\nTo help you with the pricing, some brokers offer access to liquidity pools, also known as dark pools,\\ndark liquidity, or dark books. These pools are private execution networks that can sometimes wreak\\nhavoc with the market, but when used properly, they can improve the pricing on a stock trade. Brokers\\nthat participate in these pools may place your order in the liquidity pool, and then your order will be\\nexecuted only if a matching trade exists. In this situation, the trade happens faster and often with better\\npricing than it would if it had been executed in the open market.\\nUnlike those brokerage services aimed at day traders, a traditional retail brokerage offers customers\\nmore research and advice and may even offer to improve order execution by waiting until market\\nconditions are more favorable.

The bid, of\\ncourse, is the price at which the broker buys the security from you, and the ask (also called offer in\\nsome markets) is the price at which the broker offers to sell the security to you.

They may come with a few scuffs but will probably have more\\nergonomic settings than chairs at office-supply superstores.\\nAlthough no rule stipulates the proper layout of your equipment, the more you can see and do without\\ngetting up from your chair, the better off you'll be.

You don't want to be slowed down because of an operating system update.\\nThe department of redundancy department: Backing up your\\nsystems\\nWhen you day trade, you are intentionally looking at volatile markets and fast-moving securities\\nbecause that's where you have the most opportunity to make money in a short time. You may very well\\nbe leveraged, either through the use of borrowed money or by trading securities with built-in leverage,\\nsuch as futures. (I have a lot more to say about leverage in Chapter 9.)

At the time I'm writing this, I think these options are\\na bad idea for most day traders. Even with 4G service, mobile networks can be slow and drop out, and\\nyou can't get enough information on a little screen to trade well.\\nHowever, technology changes fast, so maybe by the time you're reading this, mobile speeds have\\nbecome as fast as wired ones. This may be especially true if you live in a rural area without reliable\\nhigh-speed Internet service. The different brokerage firms (including those listed in Chapter 11 and\\nothers) are adding new and better mobile capabilities. Some of the things to look for are signaling and\\ncharting capabilities, ease of order entry, and synching to your desktop information. Also, make sure\\nthat the mobile service handles whatever asset you usually trade. Mobile apps are still relatively new as\\nfar as the trading world goes, and some can handle your strategy better than others. Still, I remain\\nskeptical that mobile trading is a good idea for an active day trader. I live in Chicago near Wrigley\\nField, and cellphone service slows to a crawl on game days. Some 40,000 fans all e-mailing pictures of\\nthemselves at the Friendly Confines to their friends takes a toll on cell towers. Sometimes, my provider\\nslows so much that only emergency service is available on game days. It's not a typical problem, to be\\nsure, but it's also not something you want to deal with as a trader. Keep that in mind when you see\\nbrokerage-firm commercials that talk about trading at the game.\\nIf you're a business traveler who gets a great idea on the road and who wants to place one order to buy\\nand hold, then great! Use your phone. If you are a swing trader or an investor who trades more than\\naverage, using a mobile device when exit or entry points happen to be great but you are out of the office\\nmay be fine.\\nIf you're a day trader placing tens or hundreds of orders a day, your muscles will cramp up from\\nentering orders with a teensy keyboard, and your speed could slow down when you least want it to.\\nHowever, a mobile platform makes a great backup system. If your broker offers phone trading, you can\\nuse it to keep in the market — or close out efficiently — if your trading system goes down or you can't\\nget access to it.\\n Although mobile trading isn't the best idea for your primary trading, mobile technology and the\\ndifferent apps that people develop for it can be really useful.

They all have services that tell you what the prices are\\nfor any security at any time, but this doesn't mean that they have all the prices that you need for your\\nstrategy. If, for example, you're day trading common stocks, you may need a system that can signal\\ncertain price patterns in any of the thousands of stocks trading at any given day. If you're trading options\\nbased on the value of underlying stock, you may need that data as well.

He's the subject of the book\\nReminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin LeFevre, a classic book about trading (see the appendix\\nfor more information). Livermore was born in 1877 and started trading stocks when he was in his teens.\\nHe claimed to have made $1,000 when he was 15, which may not seem like much, except that he was\\nvery young and that $1,000 would be worth more than $20,000 in today's dollars. He made huge\\nfortunes betting against the market in 1907 and again in 1929, and he managed to lose it all both times.\\nBy 1934 he was broke and depressed. He attempted suicide in 1935 and succeeded in 1940.\\nSteve Perkins\\nIs he a cautionary tale, or the man who learned from his mistakes? Steve Perkins is an energy trader\\nwho worked for PVM Oil Futures, a London-based firm. One night in 2009, he got very drunk, got out\\nhis laptop computer, and started buying futures; he ended up controlling almost 70 percent of the\\nworld's oil market and left his firm with $10 million in losses. He was fired and banned from trading in\\nthe U.K. However, in 2010, he was hired by an energy trading firm in Switzerland, and, it is hoped, he\\nwill not make that mistake again.\\nKnight Capital\\nKnight Capital is a company, not a person, but its story is a good one to keep in mind given how much\\nelectronic trading takes place anymore. The company is a major dealer in the stock and equity options\\nmarkets. It trades for its own account, buying and selling securities from discount brokerage firms to\\nhelp them execute trades more efficiently. In the wee hours of the morning on August 1, 2012, the\\ncompany did a software upgrade. When the market opened at 9:30 am New York time, Knight Capital\\nsent a flood of erroneous orders into the market. It turned out that there was a flaw in the software that\\nwas installed. Ooops!

Almost all day traders talk about their enemies being fear and greed. If you panic, you'll no\\nlonger be trading to win, but trading not to lose. That's an important distinction: If your goal is not\\nto lose, you won't take appropriate risk, and you won't be able to respond quickly to what the\\nmarket is telling you.\\nControlling your emotions is all much easier said than done. Human beings are emotional creatures,\\nconstantly reacting (and sometimes overreacting) to everything that happens in their lives. Knowing the\\nemotions that affect trading and having some ways to manage them can greatly improve your overall\\nperformance.\\nDealing with destructive emotions\\nIn trading, the big emotions can take over and mess up your strategy and your returns. The enemies are\\ndoubt, fear, and greed; like any bullies, they have their toadies, including anger, anxiety, boredom, and\\ndepression. At this point in your life, you may already know whether you have tendencies toward any of\\nthese moods. If so, trading can exacerbate them. If you've never experienced them, you may for the first\\ntime. The following sections explain these emotions as they relate to day trading so that you know what\\nyou're up against and can plan accordingly.\\n I include some tips that can help you deal with destructive reactions, but if you are really in the\\nthroes of an emotional crisis that affects your trading, seek professional help. And by all means,\\nwalk away from the trading desk.\\nDoubt\\nDay traders have to act fast. They have to place their buy and sell orders as the opportunities present\\nthemselves. The market doesn't give anyone time to second-guess the decisions, but many traders start\\nto do just that. Did the signal really flash? Is this pattern going to continue or reverse? Will waiting a\\nfew seconds lead to a better price? Would closing out for the day just be better?\\nI don't know. And neither do you. That's why traders need to stick to their plans, which isn't always\\neasy. Backtesting (explained in Chapter 16) can help build confidence in a plan, and the use of\\nautomated trading tools (refer to Chapter 13) can help overcome the tendency to hesitate before clicking\\non the mouse button.\\n Most brokerage firms that offer services to day traders have automated trading capabilities to\\nhelp you follow your plan. And all brokers can execute stop and limit orders, which can help you\\nget out of positions based on your plans rather than your emotions.\\nFear\\nFear is one of the worst emotional enemies of the day trader. Instead of trying to make money, the\\nfearful trader tries hard not to lose it. She is so afraid of failing that she limits herself, doesn't take\\nappropriate risk, and questions her trading system so much that she no longer follows it, no matter how\\nwell it worked for her in the past.\\nBy the way, failure isn't the only thing that traders fear.

Ah, but there's a popular saying down at\\nthe Chicago Board of Trade: “Pigs get fat, but hogs get slaughtered.”\\nTraders who get greedy start to do stupid things.

They hold positions too long in the hope of eking out a return, and\\nsometimes they make rash trades that look an awful lot like gambling. The greedy trader loses all\\ndiscipline and eventually loses quite a bit of money.\\nIf your goal is simply to make more and more money, you may have a problem with greed. Sure,\\neveryone wants to make more, but there are also a basic need-to-make number (enough to cover your\\ncosts and your basic living expenses) and a want-to-make number (enough to cover costs, basic\\nexpenses, and extras that are important to you). Your want-to-make can be open ended (as in “as much\\nas possible”), but your need-to-make should be a key component of your risk management. If you know\\nwhat those numbers are, you're well on your way to preventing the problem.\\n Limit orders, which automatically close out positions when they hit set prices, are one way to\\nforce discipline in the face of greed. You can learn more about limit orders in Chapter 2.\\nAnger\\nThe markets can be maddening. They don't do what you want them to, and that often costs you real\\nmoney. And no one wants to lose money. Your rage at the markets can cause you to stop seeing straight.\\n When anger makes it impossible to think clearly, your best bet is to call it a day, close out your\\npositions, and go somewhere far from your trading screen. Leave your phone at home if you're\\nusing your broker's mobile apps, too! Take a long walk and wait for your anger to subside.\\nOtherwise, your rage will interfere with your plans and your profitability. The only way to psych\\nout the market is to be just as mechanical and unemotional as the blips that cross your screen.\\nAnxiety\\nAnxiety is the anticipation of things going wrong, and it often includes a physical response:\\nperspiration, clenched jaws, tense muscles, heart palpitations, and so on. Anxious people worry,\\nagonize, overanalyze, and generally stress out. And then they avoid whatever it is that makes them\\nupset. That means that a trader may not make an obvious trade but instead hesitate and miss a market\\nmove. He may hold on to a losing position too long because he's worried about the effect that selling it\\nwill have on his portfolio. He becomes too nervous to trade according to his plan, and his performance\\nsuffers.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 177}),\n",

If your limits are set\\nwhen you place the trade, then your anxiety can't override your plan.\\nBoredom\\nAn ugly truth about day trading is that it can be really dull. In an eight-hour trading session, you may\\nspend seven and a half hours waiting for the right opening. A flurry of trades, and it's all over. To keep\\nyourself entertained, you may start making bad trades, spending too much time in chat rooms, or letting\\nyour mind wander away from the task at hand. None of those things is conducive to profitable trading.\\n One way to reduce the temptations brought on by boredom is to block access to social media\\non your trading computer. Several companies make software that will keep you from using\\nFacebook, Pinterest, or Addicting Games when you should be trading! A few to consider are Anti-\\nSocial (www.anti-social.cc) and Cold Turkey (www.getcoldturkey.com). Keep in\\nmind that they may slow down your system — and that your phone may need a social-media\\nblocker, too.\\nDepression\\nDepression is a severe downturn in your mood, especially one that causes you to feel inadequate and\\nlose interest in things you used to like. Although everyone is susceptible to depression, the ups and\\ndowns of the market can make traders particularly vulnerable. At best, depression can make it hard for a\\ntrader to face a day with the market. At worst, it can lead to alcoholism, alienation, and even suicide.\\n If you think you may be depressed, check out the self-assessment at\\nwww.mayoclinic.com/health/depression/MH00103_D. Or better yet, go to your\\ndoctor. He or she will give you a better diagnosis than Dr. Internet.\\nHaving an outlet\\nSuccessful day traders have a life outside the markets. They close out their positions, shut off their\\nmonitors, and go do something else with the rest of the day. The problem is that a market is always open\\nsomewhere. Undisciplined traders work overnight and after hours through electronic communications\\nnetworks and sometimes move the action to exchanges in other parts of the world. Think about Steve\\nPerkins, losing millions of dollars in the middle of the night! Without something to mark a beginning\\nand an end to your trading day, and without other things happening in your life, the market can consume\\nyou in an unhealthy way.\\n So as you plan your life as a day trader, think about what else you're going to do with your\\ndays. Exercise, meditation, socializing, and having outside interests are keys to maintaining\\nbalance and staying focused on the market when you have to be. The following sections go into\\nmore detail.\\nExercise\\nExercise keeps your body in fighting shape so that you can stand up to market stress and react to trends\\nwhen you need to.

Figuring out a regular exercise routine can pay off for your trading.\\nIf you aren't an exerciser now, call your local YMCA. It has introductory programs that can teach you\\nhow to use the equipment and help you design a workout that suits your current fitness levels and goals.\\nMeditation\\nWhen you're trading, you may get upset and start thinking about everything else that has ever gone\\nwrong in your life, instead of staying focused on the task at hand. Even after you close out your\\npositions and shut down your monitors, your day's trading may keep playing itself out over and over in\\nyour head, making it impossible for you to relax. Neither of these scenarios is good for you — or your\\ntrading.\\nTrading requires mental discipline. Good traders can keep their minds clear of everything but their\\ntrading system, at least when the markets are at their hairiest. One way to develop that discipline is to\\ntake up meditation. Yeah, it may seem goofy, being a big tough trader type doing something woo-woo\\nlike meditation, but if you have trouble keeping your focus, you really may want to give it a try. There\\nare an almost infinite number of meditation styles, many of which are associated with different religious\\ntraditions, so you can surely find something that works. Research compiled by the Center for\\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health\\n(http://nccam.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm) shows that many people\\nreport mental-health benefits from meditation.\\nCheck out the instructions for the Buddhist mindfulness meditation practice at\\nwww.shambhala.org/meditationinstruction.html as a way to get started.\\nFriends and family\\nDay trading is a lonely activity. You work by yourself all day. It's just you, your room, and your screen.\\nThis job is really isolating. If you don't get other human contact, you run the risk of personalizing the\\nmarket in order not to feel so lonely. That's bad, because the market isn't a person; it's an agglomeration\\nof all the financial activity taking place, and it has no interest in you whatsoever.\\nNo matter what you do in life, you want to have the support of the people you know and love. And you\\nneed to make time for them, too. Start and end your trading day at regular times and be sure to make\\nplans to see people who are important to you. Going to your kid's ball game, having dinner with your\\nspouse, and seeing your friends for a few beers on a regular basis can go a long way to keeping your life\\nin balance — and that will keep your trading in balance.\\n If you like pets, consider getting one to keep you company during the day. There's nothing like\\na dog that needs a walk to force you to close shop for the night.\\nHobbies and other interests\\nA lot of people get into day trading because they have long had a fascination with the market. Trading\\ngoes from being a hobby to being a living. In many ways, that's perfect. Going to work is so much\\neasier when you have a job that you love.\\nBut if the market is your only interest, then you're going to be too susceptible to its gyrations, and you're\\ngoing to have trouble sticking to your trading discipline. Plus, whatever upsets you during the trading\\nday is more likely to carry over. So find a new hobby if you don't have one. Maybe it's a TV show, a\\nsport, or knitting, but whatever it is, you need to have something going on outside of your trading.\\n Trading is just one part of your life.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 179}),\n",

Many day traders find that reading books, hiring a coach, or finding other day traders helps them\\nget through the day.\\nBooks\\nA library full of books has been written on the psychology of trading itself. In addition, many traders\\nrely on other self-help and history books for inspiration and ideas. (I think every trader I've ever known\\nowns a copy of Sun Tzu's The Art of War, which is about military strategies and tactics. They find that\\nthis book helps them prepare their minds to face the market — or at least gives them something\\ninteresting to talk about.) I list several books in the appendix that may help you organize your mind and\\nkeep your enthusiasm for the market.\\nCounseling and coaching\\nBecause handling big losses — and big gains —takes a lot of mental toughness, many traders find\\nprofessional support. They use counselors, psychologists, or life coaches to help them deal with the\\nchallenges of the market and understand their reactions to it. You can ask other traders or your doctor\\nfor a referral, or check the online directory at Psychology Today's website,\\nwww.psychologytoday.com, or the International Coach Federation,\\nwww.coachfederation.org. When interviewing coaches or counselors, ask whether they have\\nexperience with traders or others who work in finance.\\nMany day-trading training and brokerage firms also offer coaching services that specialize in helping\\npeople learn and follow day-trading strategies. Some day traders find these people to be invaluable,\\nwhereas others find they are just glorified salespeople.\\nFinding other traders\\nTo offset the loneliness of trading alone, many day traders choose to join organizations where they will\\nmeet other traders. These may be formal or informal groups (I list a few in the appendix) where traders\\ncan socialize, learn new things, or just commiserate.\\nMany day traders also get together through Internet message boards and chat rooms. I discuss this\\noption in more detail later in this chapter and list a few in the appendix. These groups are less formal,\\nmore anonymous, and sometimes as destructive as supportive.\\n Most day traders lose money and give up their first year. You may find that spending too much\\ntime with other traders is more depressing than supportive.\\nWatching your walk-away money\\nA lot of traders have a secret that lets them get through the worst of the markets. It's something called\\nwalk-away money, although traders sometimes use more colorful language to describe it. Walk-away\\nmoney is just what its name implies: enough money to let the trader walk away from trading and do\\nsomething else.\\nAnd just exactly how much walk-away money does a trader need? Well, the exact amount varies from\\nperson to person, but having enough money to pay three months’ worth of expenses on hand and in cash\\nis a good place to start. If you know that you can pay the mortgage and buy the groceries even if you\\ndon't make money trading today, you're better able to avoid desperate trading.

But some people have trouble following their plan, and that leads to stressful mistakes.\\nFollowing are some common problems and advice on how you can avoid — or overcome — them.\\nPrevent choking!\\nIn sports lingo, an athlete who chokes starts playing so carefully that he or she looks like a beginner.\\nChoking is often caused by overthinking — by being so afraid of failure that the mind slows down and\\nbreaks the play down step by step. Watching a contender break down in a championship game isn't\\npretty. The fans want to see a good match.\\nAnyone in a high-performance situation can choke. When a trader chokes, he seems to be following the\\nplan, but it's no longer automatic. Trading becomes so slow and deliberative that obvious trades get\\nmissed.\\n The more you trust your plan, the less likely you are to choke. Has it been tested? Are there\\nparts that you can automate? Chapter 16 has some ideas on how to measure a trading plan's\\nperformance before you start to trade with the plan.\\nReduce panic\\nPanic occurs when you just stop thinking. Your most basic survival instincts take over, even when they\\nare totally uncalled for. You're losing money? You start to trade more and more, off-plan, in a desperate\\ngamble to win it back.

You\\ncan't trade with a clear head if you're bogged down with negative thoughts.\\nNurture your confidence, not your ego\\nDay trading requires a lot of confidence because you are going to lose money and you are going to get\\nbeaten up some days.

Here I give an overview of different types of day-\\ntrading assets and some of the tax implications associated with them.\\nCommodities and futures\\nOf the many reasons that day traders work with commodity and futures contacts, one is that the taxes\\nare easy to handle. Under Section 1256 of the IRS code, certain types of contracts — for example,\\nregulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts, and non-equity options (on debt, commodities,\\ncurrencies, and stock market indexes) that are marked-to-market in trading — are handled under the\\n60/40 rule. This rule stipulates that 60 percent of your total capital gain or loss will be treated as a long-\\nterm capital gain or loss, and the other 40 percent of your gain or loss will be treated as a short-term\\ngain or loss. How long you held the position doesn't matter. Why is this rule so nice? Because the long-\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 184}),\n",

How\\ntaxes apply to you can be impacted by the following:\\nWhether you're an individual or a business: Small individual currency transactions are usually\\nconsidered to be like-kind exchanges; for example, if you go on vacation to Mexico, exchange your\\ndollars to pesos when the dollar is strong, and then change whatever remains back at the border a\\nweek later when the dollar is a bit weaker, you'll have made a profit. However, this transaction is\\nnot a reportable one, because, in essence, you exchanged two identical items: money for money.\\nA business, however, can accrue taxable gains and losses due to changes in exchange rates. If a\\ncompany makes goods in the United States and sells them through its Mexican subsidiary, for\\nexample, the amount of profit or loss that the subsidiary has depends on the exchange rate between\\nthe dollar and the peso, and that determines the amount of tax that the company pays. In this case,\\nidentical objects aren't being exchanged. (The IRS has plenty of rules on how businesses should\\nhandle foreign exchange under Section 988 of the tax code.)\\nWhether you're trading actual currency or futures and options on currencies: Futures and\\noptions on currencies are taxed under Section 1256 using the handy 60/40 rule described in the\\npreceding section. But you're trading in the spot market. You aren't trading currency contracts;\\nyou're trading actual currency. What do you do about profits and losses you may accrue?\\nThe IRS isn't keen on your claiming a tax-free like-kind exchange if your goal is to make a living\\ntrading currencies. But you aren't running a business with overseas operations, are you?\\nUnfortunately, there are no clear guidelines here, so you probably want to work with an accountant.\\nThe general thought is that you can report your currency trading through Section 988 or Section\\n1256. Under Section 988, your trading gains and losses are considered short-term capital gains in\\nyour trading business. This arrangement saves you money if you lost money trading but costs you if\\nyou made money. Under Section 1256, your spot trading is handled as futures contracts, and you\\npay short-term capital gains taxes on 40 percent of your profits and long-term capital gains taxes on\\nthe remaining 60 percent of your profit. This saves you money in the years you made money.\\nThe key? Be consistent. You can't file under Section 988 when you lose money and under Section\\n1256 in years you make money. That game makes the IRS very unhappy, and you don't want to\\nhave the tax guys unhappy with you.\\n Although you should consider this entire chapter as a guideline and not professional tax advice,\\nthis warning holds particularly true for the information on currencies. At the time I am writing\\nthis, both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Internal Revenue Service are\\ntaking a close look at the forex market to clarify the regulations, so the information may be very\\ndifferent when you do your taxes.\\nOptions\\nThe taxation of options is more complicated than the taxation of other derivatives. The basic\\ninformation is the same: A gain on an option held for less than a year is a short-term capital gain, and a\\ngain on one held for more than a year is a long-term capital gain. There are two problems, though. The\\nfirst is that some options strategies offer a combination of short-term and long-term gains and losses.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 185}),\n",

An\\noption on a stock is considered to be substantially identical to the stock. That's why the tax treatment is\\npretty much the same — and why professional tax advice is really important if you're trading options.\\n The Chicago Board Options Exchange publishes a detailed guide to stock and stock-options\\ntaxation. You can download it at\\nwww.cboe.com/LearnCenter/pdf/TaxesandInvesting.pdf.\\nStock trading\\nIn Chapter 4, I cover the differences between investing, trading, and gambling. Day traders aren't\\ninvesting; they're looking to take advantage of short-term price movements, not to take a stake in a\\nbusiness for the long term. Unless, of course, you're asking the IRS about it. The IRS defines trading\\nmuch differently than people in financial circles do. To the taxmen, you are a trader only if all of the\\nfollowing apply to you:\\nYou seek to profit from daily market movements in the prices of securities, not from dividends,\\ninterest, or capital appreciation.\\nYour activity is substantial; the IRS code does not spell out what substantial means, but it probably\\nmeans you're making at least 3,000 trades per year.\\nYou carry on the activity with continuity and regularity. In other words, day trading is more or less\\nyour full-time job, you've stuck with it for at least six months already, and you plan to keep trading\\ninto the next year.\\n The 2013 Tax Court case Endicott v. Commissioner addressed the issue of substantial when\\ndeciding whether a person is a trader. The plaintiff made 1,543 trades in 2008, which the IRS said\\nwas substantial. The 303 trades made in 2007 did not meet the definition. The taxpayer traded on\\n75 days in 2006, 99 days in 2007, and 112 days in 2008, and the court ruled that none of those met\\nthe requirement for frequent, continuous, or regular trading. This ruling is the clearest guidance\\nissued in a long time.\\nIRS Tax Topic 429 covers the matter in more detail. If you trade part-time, have other employment, or\\nare new to the day-trading game, the IRS probably won't let you define yourself as a trader. Don't care\\nwhat an IRS agent calls you, as long she doesn't call you for an audit? Well, understanding the\\ndifference between trader and investor in IRS lingo is important to avoid that audit.\\n Those who qualify as traders enjoy deductions that regular investors don't. You may quality as\\na trader for some of your activities and as an investor for others. If you think this scenario applies\\nto you, you need to keep detailed records to separate your trades, and you should use different\\nbrokerage accounts to make the difference clear from the day you open the position.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 186}),\n",

The second is to encourage people to do things that the elected officials who amend\\nthe tax code want them to do. Much of the investing tax code is intended to promote the formation\\nand growth of businesses. Short-term day trading doesn't do that, so the tax law doesn't offer\\nshort-term investors the same benefits that it gives to long-term investors and business owners.\\nHiring a T ax Adviser\\nYou don't have to hire someone to do your taxes, but you probably should.

They receive registration from the\\nIRS after passing a two-day, eight-hour exam covering only tax topics, which is what they know\\nbest. They may not be so good at helping you with other accounting needs, such as preparing\\npayroll for your office assistants.\\nTax attorneys: Tax attorneys usually work with CPAs; they are called in to study the legality of\\nproposed strategies or represent a client in tax litigation. They aren't appropriate for most traders,\\nbut you may have situations that call for one.\\nStorefronts and volunteers (probably not a good idea): Every winter, vacant buildings are turned\\ninto tax-preparation centers, and the IRS promotes its cadre of volunteers who help people with\\ntheir taxes. These services can be a boon to the average person who lacks the time or patience to\\ndeal with the tax forms. But if you are trader, you're going to run into complex problems that most\\nof these services are not prepared to handle, such as the many considerations that go with taxes on\\ncurrency trading discussed previously.\\n Only CPAs, enrolled agents, and tax attorneys are allowed to represent clients before the IRS\\nin audits, collections, or appeals.

All the regulations,\\npublications, forms, and explanations are there, and some of it is even in plain English.

       " Document(page_content=\"189\\n Curious to know about this State of Alaska Permanent Fund? It's an annual payment made to\\nall residents of Alaska every year, based on the profits of oil pumped in that state. To put this\\namount into context, Alaska had 731,449 residents in 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\\nI think there are two pages of IRS publications mentioning the fund for every person who gets a\\ncheck from it.\\n The primary publication that covers the tax implications of trading and other investing\\nactivities is Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses. It's available at\\nwww.irs.gov/publications/p550/.\\nMaking it easier with tax-preparation software\\nThe brave people who do their own taxes know that tax-prep software is a godsend, and it's even more\\nvaluable for those do-it-yourselfers who trade a lot. The software fills out the forms, automatically adds\\nand subtracts, and even catches typographical errors. In many cases, it can download data straight from\\nyour brokerage account, making data entry really simple.\\nMost of the big brands, such as TaxCut and TurboTax, publish several editions each year — not all of\\nwhich are set up to import and manage lots of trading data. Among those that have services for investors\\nare TurboTax Premier Investments (www.turbotax.com), H&R Block at Home Premium\\n(www.hrblock.com), and CompleteTax (www.completetax.com).\\nIncome Categories Y ou Need to Know\\nIncome seems like a straightforward concept, but not much about taxation is straightforward. To the\\nIRS, income falls into different categories, with different tax rates, different allowed deductions, and\\ndifferent forms to fill out. In this section, I cover income definitions you'll run into as a day trader.\\nEarned income\\nEarned income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips. It's money that you make on the job. But\\neven if day trading is your only occupation, your earnings are not considered to be earned income.\\nTherefore day traders, whether classified for tax purposes as investors or traders, don't have to pay the\\nself-employment tax on their trading income. Isn't that great?\\nWell, maybe, maybe not. The self-employment tax, the bane of many an independent business person, is\\na contribution to the Social Security fund. (Employees pay half of the contribution, and the employer\\npays the other half. The self-employed have to pay the whole thing.)\\nThe problem is that if you don't have earned income, you are not paying into Social Security. If you are\\nnot paying into Social Security, you may not be eligible for retirement benefits. To collect benefits, you\\nhave to have paid in 40 credits, and you can earn a maximum of four credits per year. Most employees\\ndo this easily, but if you've taken time off work or have a long history of work as an independent\\ninvestor, you may not have paid enough in.\\n Any Social Security benefits you do collect are based on the 35 years of highest earned income\\nover your work history. Your years of independent trading show up as years with zero earned\\nincome, which may hurt your ultimate benefit.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 189}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"190\\n The Social Security Administration has a handy online calculator,\\nwww.socialsecurity.gov/planners/calculators.htm, which can help you\\ndetermine whether day trading makes sense for you right now, given the possible effect on your\\nSocial Security benefits.\\nInvestment income\\nInvestment income is your total income from property held for investment before any deductions. It\\nincludes interest, dividends, annuities, and royalties. Investment income does not include net capital\\ngains, unless you choose to include them. Do you want to include them? Well, read the next section.\\nOther than net capital gains, which you may or may not decide to include, most day traders have very\\nlittle investment income for tax purposes.\\nCapital gains and losses\\nA capital gain is the profit you make when you buy low and sell high — the aim of day trading. The\\nopposite of a capital gain is a capital loss, which happens when you sell an asset for less than you paid\\nfor it. Investors can offset some of their capital gains with some of their capital losses to reduce their tax\\nburden.\\n Frequent traders have many capital gains and losses, though, and they may very well run afoul\\nof complicated IRS rules about capital gains taxation. Day traders get tripped up by capital gain\\nand loss problems all the time. When designing your trading strategy, think long and hard about\\nhow much pain taxes may cause. The financial world is filled with horror stories of people who\\nthought they found a clever angle on making big profits, only to discover at tax time that their tax\\nliability was greater than their profit. In the real world, taxes matter.\\nCapital gains come in two flavors: short term and long term. You're charged a low rate (the current rate\\nis 15 percent) on long-term capital gains, which right now is defined as the gain on assets held for more\\nthan one year. Short-term capital gains, which are those made on any asset held for one year or less, are\\ntaxed at the ordinary income rate, probably 28 percent or more.\\nCalculating capital gains and losses: Covering all your basis\\nCapital gains and losses are calculated using a security's basis, which may or may not be the same as the\\nprice that you paid for it or sold it at. Some expenses, such as commissions or disallowed wash-sale\\nlosses (both of which are discussed later in this chapter), are added to the cost of the security, and that\\ncan reduce the amount of your taxable gain or increase the amount of your deductible loss.\\nFor example, if you bought 100 shares of stock at $50 per share and a $0.03 per share commission, your\\nbasis would be $5,003 — the $5,000 you paid for the stock and the $3 you paid in commission.\\nUnderstanding the wash-sale rule\\nSuppose you love LMNO Company, but the price of the shares is down from what it was when you\\npurchased them. You'd like to get that loss on your taxes, so you sell the stock, and then you buy it back\\nat the lower price. You get your tax deduction and still keep the stock. How excellent is that?\\nIt's too excellent to be true. This trick is called a wash sale, and the IRS does not count the loss. The\\nwash-sale rule was designed to keep long-term investors from playing cute with their taxes, but it has\\nthe effect of creating a ruinous tax situation for naïve day traders.\\nSeeing the rule in action\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 190}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"191\\n Under the wash-sale rule, you cannot deduct a loss if you have both a gain and a loss in the\\nsame security within a 61-day period. (That's calendar days, not trading days, so weekends and\\nholidays count.) However, you can add the disallowed loss to the basis of your security.\\nHere's an example to illustrate. On Tuesday, you bought 100 shares of LMNO at $34.60. LMNO\\nannounced terrible earnings, and the stock promptly dropped to $29.32, and you sold all 100 shares for\\na loss of $528. Later in the afternoon, you noticed that the stock had bottomed and looked like it might\\ntrend up, so you bought another 100 shares at $28.75 and resold them an hour later at $29.25, closing\\nout your position for the day. The second trade had a profit of $50. You had a net loss of $478 (the $528\\nloss plus the $50 profit). Here's how this works out tax-wise: The IRS disallows the $528 loss and lets\\nyou show only a profit of $50. But it lets you add the $528 loss to the basis of your replacement shares,\\nso instead of spending $2,875 (100 shares times $28.75), for tax purposes, you spent $3,403 ($2,875\\nplus $528), which means that the second trade caused you to lose the $478 that you added back. On a\\nnet basis, you get to record your loss. The basis addition lets you work off your wash-sale losses\\neventually, assuming that you keep careful records and have more winning trades than losing ones in\\nany one security.\\n To make the calculations easier, several different tax-software packages can download trade\\ndata from your brokerage account to keep track of your tax situation. One to check out is\\nTradeLog, www.armencomp.com/tradelog. Even if you hire someone to do your taxes,\\ntracking your potential liabilities as you trade can help you avoid costly mistakes.\\nThe wash-sale rule applies to substantially similar securities. LMNO stock and LMNO options are\\nconsidered to be substantially similar, so you can't get around the rule by varying securities on the same\\nunderlying asset. LMNO shares and shares of its closest competitor, PQRS, would probably not be\\nconsidered substantially similar, so you can trade within a given industry to help avoid wash-sale\\nproblems.\\nGetting around the wash-sale rule\\n At an extreme, the wash-sale rule can mean that traders who are in and out of the same\\nsecurities over and over may be taxed on all their winning trades, without being able to subtract\\ntheir losing trades for tax purposes. If your winning trades gained $300,000, and your losing\\ntrades cost you $200,000, you cleared $100,000 — but the IRS may tax you on the $300,000.\\nOuch!\\n There are ways around the wash-sale rule. The obvious solution is to qualify as a trader for IRS\\npurposes and then take the mark-to-market accounting election (covered in the section “Mark-to-\\nmarket accounting”). Other methods for avoiding the wash-sale rule include trading a given\\nsecurity only once every 60 calendar days and doing all your trading within a qualified retirement\\naccount such as an IRA (also discussed later in this chapter). Some securities are handled\\ndifferently. Futures contracts are considered to generate investment income and losses, not capital\\ngains, and so they are not covered by the wash-sale rule, which makes them a popular alternative\\nfor day traders. Profits on options contracts are 60 percent long-term capital gains and 40 percent\\nshort-term capital gains, which reduce the wash-sale rule effect.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 191}),\n",

This kind of income is often payment received in the course of a business or trade. As a\\nfreelancer, most of my income is reported to the IRS in the miscellaneous category. Anyone who pays\\nme for my services has to send me Form 1099-Misc at the end of the year, with a copy going to the IRS,\\nto help the agency track my earnings. Some proprietary traders that provide services for day traders\\n(covered in Chapter 11) report your profits and losses on Form1099-MISC. Miscellaneous income is\\nhandled as self-employment income and must be reported.\\nTracking Y our Investment Expenses\\nDay traders have expenses. They buy computer equipment, subscribe to research services, pay trading\\ncommissions, and hire accountants to prepare their taxes. It adds up, and the tax code recognizes that.\\nThat's why day traders can deduct many of their costs from their income taxes. In this section, I go\\nthrough some of what you can deduct.\\n You can make your life much easier by keeping track of your expenses as you incur them. You\\ncan keep these records in a notebook, in a spreadsheet, or through personal finance software such\\nas Quicken or Microsoft Money.\\nQualified and deductible expenses\\nYou can deduct investment expenses as miscellaneous itemized deductions on Schedule A of Form\\n1040 as long as these expenses are ordinary, necessary, directly related to the taxable income produced,\\nand used to produce or collect income or manage property held for producing income.\\nClerical, legal, and accounting fees\\nYou may use the services of a lawyer to help you get set up, and you will almost definitely want to use\\nan accountant who understands investment expenses to help you evaluate your trading strategy and\\nprepare your state and federal income tax returns each year. There's good news here: You can deduct\\nattorney and accounting fees related to your investment income. If your trading operation gets big\\nenough that you hire clerical help to keep track of all those trade confirmations, you can deduct that\\ncost, too.\\nOffice expenses\\nIf you do your day trading from an outside office, you can deduct the rent and related expenses. You can\\ndeduct the expenses of a home office, too, as long as you use it regularly and exclusively for business. If\\nyour trading room is also the guest room, it doesn't count.\\nWhether or not you deduct your office, you can deduct certain office expenses for equipment and\\nsupplies used in your business. You can usually write off roughly $100,000 in computers, desks, chairs,\\nand the like if you use them for trading more than half of the time.

It may be helpful to think of deductible expenses as\\ndiscounts, because in the end that's more or less what they are.\\nInvestment counsel and advice\\nThe IRS allows you to deduct fees paid for counsel and advice about investments that produce taxable\\nincome. This advice includes books, magazines, newspapers, and research services that help you refine\\nyour trading strategy. It also includes anything you may pay for investment advisory services, such as\\ntrade coaching or analysis.\\nBy the way, you can probably deduct what you paid for Day Trading For Dummies.

If you also keep jewelry that you inherited and never wear or other\\npersonal items in the same box, you can only deduct part of the rent.\\nInvestment interest\\nIf you borrow money as part of your strategy, and most day traders do, you can deduct the interest paid\\non those loans as long as it is not from a home mortgage (because that interest is already deductible) and\\nas long as you are not subject to other limitations set forth in the IRS code, such as the Alternative\\nMinimum Tax. There's always a catch, isn't there? In most cases, the catch is margin interest (see\\nChapter 9 for more information on margin). For most day traders, margin interest is relatively small\\nbecause few day traders borrow money for more than a few hours at a time.\\n If you borrow money against your account for anything other than investing or trading, you\\ncan't deduct the interest. And yes, most brokerage firms let you take out margin for your own\\ngeneral spending, as a way to let you stay in the market and still get cash.\\nState income taxes\\nIf you itemize your deductions, you can deduct, as taxes, state income taxes on interest income that is\\nexempt from federal income tax. But you cannot deduct, as either taxes or investment expenses, state\\nincome taxes on other exempt income. In most cases, exempt income is related to government bond\\ntransactions, and few day traders work in those markets.\\n The 50 states all have different rules about taxation of investment income. Some states with\\nlittle or no tax on earned income handle investment income differently. Because there are so many\\ndifferent issues, state taxation is beyond the scope of this book. Check with your state revenue\\ndepartment and a state-savvy tax expert to see what you need to know where you live.\\nWhat you can't deduct\\nAs you day trade, you'll probably incur expenses that can't be deducted from your taxes. Disappointing,\\nI know, but if you know what these nondeductible expenses are upfront, you can plan accordingly.\\nWhat? I can't deduct commissions?\\nEvery time you make a trade, you have to pay a commission to your broker.

And you can't deduct that cost.\\nBefore you splutter in outrage, read this: You can't deduct it, but you can add it to cost and subtract it\\nfrom the proceeds of your trade.

Your total profit\\nfor tax purposes is $2,994 – $2,946, or $48.00.\\n Including the commission in the basis of your trade works like a deduction in terms of the\\namount of tax you pay, but because it's not a deduction, it's not subject to the limitations that affect\\nthe deductibility of other expenses.\\nIf your state charges transfer taxes on securities, they are handled the same way as commissions.\\nAttending stockholders’ meetings\\nCompanies hold annual meetings for their shareholders, usually at or near the company headquarters.\\nSometimes these meetings are deathly dull: The board of directors sits around a conference room in a\\nlaw office and goes through a boilerplate agenda with nothing to discuss. Others are extravaganzas\\nwhere the company shows off new products, showcases major accomplishments, and takes questions\\nfrom anyone in attendance.

You can deduct passive activity losses only up to the amount of your passive activity\\nincome, and you can use credits from passive activity losses only against tax on the income from\\npassive activities. Day trading is generally considered to be active, because you are materially\\nparticipating, but if you are generating passive losses from other investment activities, you probably\\nwon't be able to use them to offset your day-trading gains.\\nInterest expense limitations\\nThe IRS allows you to deduct investment interest up to the amount of your net investment income,\\nwhich is your investment income less all your allowable deductible expenses except for interest. If you\\nlost money trading, you can't use the interest deduction to reduce your taxes.

If you trade as your job, make thousands of trades a year, and rarely hold any position for more\\nthan a day, then you can fill out something called Form 3115, Application for Change in Accounting\\nMethod, and tell the IRS that you want to use the mark-to-market election in calculating your capital\\ngains and losses. Form 3115 isn't an easy form to fill out, so you should have a professional do it for\\nyou.\\nThe form has to be submitted with your prior year's tax return. If you want to use mark-to-market\\naccounting in 2012, for example, you need to submit Form 3115 when you send your 2011 tax return in\\nApril 2012.\\n You can't use the election in your first year of trading.

I cover both in the following sections.\\nMark-to-market accounting\\nUnder mark-to-market accounting, you no longer have to track capital gains. Instead, you pretend to sell\\nyour portfolio at the end of the year and then pretend to repurchase everything at the beginning of the\\nnew year so that all capital gains fall into income.\\nBecause day traders usually close all their positions at the end of the day anyway, mark-to-market\\naccounting may not seem like a big deal, but it is: In effect, converting all capital gains to income means\\nthat your trades are no longer subject to the wash-sale rule. For most day traders, this lowers taxes and\\nresults in fewer paperwork hassles.\\n If you use mark-to-market accounting, you can no longer get the 15 percent rate on any long-\\nterm capital gains from your trading activities. Unless you work with listed options on market\\nindexes, which are considered to show profits that are 60 percent long-term capital gains and 40\\npercent short-term capital gains, you may not have any long-term capital gains from your trading\\nactivities.\\nGreater deductibility of business expenses\\nIn general, the IRS allows investors to deduct business expenses only if these expenses exceed 2 percent\\nof adjusted gross income. However, anyone who gets to join the charmed circle of IRS-qualified traders\\ngets to deduct 100 percent of expenses, regardless of their adjusted gross income. They get to deduct all\\ntheir investment interest, too.\\nOne caveat, though: The IRS assumes that people are in the business of trading because they are making\\nmoney at it. If you lose money for three out of five years, even if it's because your expenses exceeded\\nyour investment profits rather than due to trading losses, the IRS will probably kick you out of the club.\\nOther Important T ax Info: Forms and\\nDeadlines\\nKnowing what constitutes income, what expenses you can deduct, and what special rules apply if the\\nIRS considers you a qualified trader is all well and good, but when it comes right down to it, you still\\nneed to know the more mundane things like what tax forms to fill out and when they're due.

You should\\nattach Form 4952 if you used it to figure your investment interest expense. You report capital gains\\nand losses from your trading on Schedule D of Form 1040, subject to all the limits on losses.\\nPaying all year: The joy of estimated taxes\\nIf you have been an employee for years and years, all your tax liabilities may have been covered by\\nyour payroll tax deductions. The IRS likes it best that way, because then it gets money all year round.\\nFace it: the easier it is to pay, the more likely you are to do it.\\nPeople who are self-employed or who have significant earnings from investments and day trading may\\ngenerate more income than can be covered from payroll withholding. What you need to do is estimate\\nyour tax liability four times a year and then write a check for those amounts. (Otherwise, you could face\\na penalty at tax time.) Estimated taxes are paid on Form 1040 ES and are due April 15, June 15,\\nSeptember 15, and January 15.\\nUsing Self-Directed IRAs\\nMuch of the tax hassle associated with day trading is eliminated if you trade through a self-directed\\nindividual retirement account, or IRA. Most brokerage firms can set them up for you and handle the\\nnecessary paperwork. Although individuals can contribute only $5,000 per year ($6,000 for people\\nolder than 50), the money can be substantial for those who have been contributing for a long time. Also,\\nyou can roll over money from an employer's retirement plan, such as a 401(k), into an IRA after you\\nleave.\\nYou don't have to pay taxes in an IRA until you retire, and then withdrawals are generally treated as\\nordinary income. For this reason, an IRA is a great vehicle for day traders: You can post big gains,\\ncount all your losses, and avoid wash-sale rules for trading within your IRA. It's a sweet way to let your\\nprofits accumulate and compound for years. Of course, there's a catch: You can't sell short, you can't use\\nall options strategies, and your brokerage firm may not want to clear funds through the IRA.\\n If you are a full-time trader, consider keeping your retirement fund completely separate from\\nyour trading funds. That way, you can pay the bills in your golden years without worrying about\\nwhat happens every trading day. It's a way to reduce stress, plus many retirement funds have tax\\nbenefits that may help the bottom line on your trading business.\\n You can't withdraw money from an IRA account until you turn 59 ½. If you take money out\\nearlier, you pay a 10 percent tax penalty, and that offsets a lot of the advantages. If you need\\nincome from your trading activities to cover your living expenses before then, an IRA is probably\\nnot the best way to set up your day-trading account.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 197}),\n",

And then, on a periodic basis (at least monthly), you should\\nreview your progress to see how much money you're making and whether you need to change your\\nstrategy.\\nBefore Y ou T rade: T esting Y our System\\nPerformance measurement starts before the trading does. That's because you want to figure out how\\nyou'll trade before you start working with real money. Chapter 3 describes some of the different\\nsecurities that can be traded on a daily basis, whereas Chapters 6 through cover some of the strategies\\nthat day traders use. After you figure out the combinations of securities and strategies you want to use,\\nyou want to see whether they would have made you money in the past. Then you should try them to see\\nwhether they still work now.\\nThe happy news? You can do all this without risking a dime, except of course for the money you may\\nspend on backtesting and simulation software. You knew there had to be a catch, right? Consider it an\\ninvestment in the success of your business.\\nBacktesting\\nIn backtesting, a trader specifies the strategy that he or she would use and then runs that strategy\\nthrough a database of historic securities prices to see whether it would have made money. The test\\nincludes assumptions about commissions, leverage, and position size. The results give information on\\nreturns, volatility, and win-loss ratios that you can use to refine a trading strategy and implement it well.\\nStarting with a hypothesis\\nWhat trades do you want to do? After you figure out what and how to trade, you can start setting forth\\nwhat your strategy will be. Will you look for high-momentum, small-cap stocks? Seek price changes\\nrelated to news events in agricultural commodities? Ride large-cap stocks within their ranges? Arbitrage\\nstock index futures and their options?\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"199After you do your research, you can lay out your strategy as a hypothesis, which may be something like\\nthis: “High-momentum, small-cap stocks tend to close up for the day, so I can buy them in the morning\\nand make money selling them in the afternoon.” Or this: “News events take at least half an hour to\\naffect corn prices, so I can buy or sell on the news and make a profit.” With this statement, you can\\nmove on to the test to see whether your hypothesis holds.\\n One of the most valuable parts about backtesting is that you have to be very specific about\\nwhat your trading rule is. Computers cannot understand vague instructions, and if you find that\\nyour trading strategy is too complicated to write out and set into a backtesting program, it's\\nprobably too complicated for you to follow.\\nRunning the test\\nSay you start with something simple: Maybe you have reason to think that pharmaceutical companies\\nthat are moving down in price on decreasing volume will turn and close up for the day. The first thing\\nyou do is enter that into the software: the industry group and the buy pattern that you're looking for. The\\nresults will show whether your hunch is correct and how often and for what time periods.\\nIf you like what you see, you can add more variables. What happens if you add leverage (use borrowed\\nmoney) in your trades? Leverage increases your risk of loss, but it also increases your potential return.\\nHow does that affect your trade? Suppose you increase the size of your trades, making fewer but larger\\nones. Would that help you make more money or less? By playing around with the system, you can get a\\ngood sense of the best way to make money with your trade ideas. You can also get a sense of when your\\nrule won't work, which can help you avoid problems.\\nIf your strategy doesn't work in testing, you want to ask yourself why not. Is your theory not as good as\\nyou thought, or are the markets different now? And if they are different now, how are they different?\\nUnless you can answer those questions, you're just engaging in wishful thinking, and wishful thinking\\nwill destroy any trader, no matter what the test results may be.\\nMost backtesting software allows for optimization, which means that it can come up with the leverage,\\nposition, holding period, and other parameters that will generate the best risk-adjusted return given the\\ndata on hand. You can then compare this result to your trading style and your capital position to see\\nwhether it works.\\n Backtesting is subject to something that traders call over-optimization, mathematicians call\\ncurve-fitting, and analysts call data mining. All these terms mean that the person performing the\\ntest looks at a past time where the market performed well and then identifies all the variables and\\nspecifications that generated that performance. Although over-optimization sounds great, what\\noften happens is that the test generates a model that includes unnecessary variables and that makes\\nno logical sense in practice. If you find a strategy that works when the stock closes up one day,\\ndown two days, then up a third day, followed by four down days when it hits an intra-day high,\\nyou probably haven't made an amazing discovery; you've just fit the curve.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 199}),\n",

Although almost all a day trader's gains come\\nfrom short-term capital gains, I go over the definitions of each so that you know the differences.\\nIncome\\nWhen investors talk about income returns, they mean regular payments from their investments, usually\\nin the form of dividends from stock or interest payments on bonds. As a day trader, you may earn\\nincome on the cash balance in your brokerage account but probably not from your trading activities.\\nCapital gains\\nA capital gain is the price appreciation in an asset — a stock, a bond, a house, or whatever it is that\\nyou're investing in. You buy it at one price, sell it at another, and the difference is a capital gain.\\n(Unless, of course, you sell the asset for less than you paid, and then you have a capital loss.)\\nFor tax purposes, capital gains are classified as either long-term or short-term. Under the current tax\\nlaw, any capital gain on an asset held for less than one year is considered to be a short-term gain, and if\\nthe asset is owned for one year or more before it's sold, then it's considered to be a long-term capital\\ngain. The difference isn't semantic; long-term capital gains are taxed at lower rates than short-term\\ncapital gains. You can read all about that and then some in Chapter 15.\\n Income in tax terms is different from income in financial terms. Much of what an investor\\nwould consider to be a capital gain, such as the short-term capital gains that day traders generate,\\nthe IRS considers to be income.\\nCalculating returns\\nGive someone with a numerical bent a list of numbers and a calculator, and she can some up with\\nseveral different relationships between the numbers. After the asset values for each time period have\\nbeen determined, rates of return can be calculated. But how? And over how long a time period? The\\nprocess gets a little more complicated because money is coming in and going out while the asset values\\nmove up and down. The following sections outline different calculations you can use to figure out your\\ninvestment returns.\\nCalculating compound average rate of return (CAGR)\\nThe most common way to calculate investment returns is to use a time-weighted average. This method\\nis perfect for traders who start with one pool of money and don't add to it or take money out. This is\\nalso called the compound average rate of return (CAGR). If you are looking at only one month or one\\nyear, it's a simple percentage. To calculate performance on a percentage basis, you use this equation:\\nEOY represents the end of year asset value, and BOY represents the beginning of year value. The result\\nis the percentage return for one year, and to calculate it, you use simple arithmetic.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 206}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"207Now if you want to look at your return over a period of several years, you need to look at the compound\\nreturn rather than the simple return for each year. The compound return shows you how your investment\\nis growing. You are getting returns on top of returns, and that's a good thing. But the math gets a little\\ncomplicated because now you have to use the root function on your calculator. The equation for\\ncompound annual growth looks like this:\\nEOP represents the end of the total time period, BOP represents the beginning of the total time period,\\nand N is the number of years that you're looking at.\\nThe basic percentage rate of return is great; it's an accurate, intuitive measure of how much gain you're\\ngenerating from your trading activities. As long as you don't take any money out of your trading\\naccount or put any money into it, you're set.\\nCalculating performance when you make deposits and withdrawals\\nYou may be putting money into your account. Maybe you have a salaried job and are day trading on the\\nside, or maybe your spouse gives you a percentage of his income to add to your trading account. You\\nmay also be taking money out of your day-trading account to cover your living expenses or to put into\\nother investment opportunities. All that money flowing into and out of your account can really screw up\\nyour performance calculation. You need a way to calculate the performance of your trading system\\nwithout considering the deposits and withdrawals to your trading account.\\nHere's an example: You start day trading on January 1 with $100,000 in your account. On May 1, your\\nincome tax refund from last year arrives, and you add $1,000 of the money to your account and start\\ntrading with it. On December 1, you take out $5,000 to buy holiday presents. At the end of the year,\\nyour account is worth $115,000. How did you do?\\nAs a day trader, you have a few methods at your disposal for calculating your performance when you\\nmake withdrawals and deposits:\\nThe Modified Dietz method loses a little accuracy but makes up for it with simplicity.\\nThe time-weighted rate of return isolates investment and trading performance from the rest of the\\naccount.\\nThe dollar-weighted rate of return has many flaws but gives a sense of what the account holder\\nhas.\\nRead on to see the return that would be calculated using each of these methods.\\nModified Dietz method\\nThe Modified Dietz method is related to the simple percent change formula, but it adjusts the beginning\\nand ending period amounts for the cash inflows and cash outflows. The equation for the Modified Dietz\\nmethod looks like this:\\nIf you plug in the numbers from the example, you get\\nDo the math and you see that the result is 19.8 percent.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 207}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"208The advantage of the Modified Dietz method is that it's so easy to do. You can use it when you want a\\nrough idea of how you are doing with your trading but you don't have the time to run a more detailed\\nanalysis. The key disadvantage is that it doesn't consider the timing of the deposits and withdrawals. It\\nwould generate the same answer if you took out $5,000 in May and put in $1,000 in December, even\\nthough the amount of money you would have to trade between May 1 and December 1 would be very\\ndifferent.\\nTime-weighted rate of return\\nThe time-weighted rate of return shows the investment performance as a percentage of the assets at\\nhand to trade. This method is the standard of trader evaluation, but the math is much more complicated\\nthan with the basic percentage change or the Modified Dietz method. You need to calculate the CAGR\\nfor each time period and then do a second calculation to incorporate each of those over a longer period.\\nUsing the preceding example, you'd calculate one return for the first four months of the year, another for\\nthe next seven months, and then a third return for the month of December. These three returns would\\nthen be multiplied to generate a return for the year.\\nThe general equation you use to figure the time-weighted rate of return looks like this:\\nN is the total number of time periods that you are looking at, and rpn is the return for that particular time\\nperiod. To make the calculations easier, you can do it in a spreadsheet. Figure 16-4 shows the time-\\nweighted return for this example. As you can see, the result is 18.78 percent, a little below the Modified\\nDietz return.\\nFigure 16-4:  Here's an example of the time-weighted rate of return calculation.\\n If you plan on adding to or taking money out of your account, you can make your return\\ncalculations much easier by setting a regular schedule and sticking to it. Otherwise, you have to do\\ncalculations for fractional time periods. It's not impossible, but it's kind of a hassle.\\n The time-weighted rate of return gives you the best sense of your trading performance, and its\\nprecision more than offsets the complexity of the calculation. You want to look at this number\\nwhen you are deciding whether to change or refine your strategy.\\nDollar-weighted returns\\nThe dollar-weighted return, also called the money-weighted return, is the rate that makes the net present\\nvalue of a stream of numbers equal to zero. That calculation is also called the internal rate of return or\\nIRR, and it is used for other things than just return calculations. You can use it to determine what the\\nreturn is for a stream of numbers over time and to calculate returns when you're putting money into or\\ntaking money out of your trading account. And if you have a financial calculator such as the Hewlett-\\nPackardHP17BII+ or the Texas Instruments BA2+, the calculations are pretty easy.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 208}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"209\\n Ah, but there's a catch! Although useful, the dollar-weighted method can misstate returns and\\noccasionally shows nonsensical results if too many negative returns appear in a series.

The withdrawals affect the account's\\nspending power, offsetting the investment performance. But the overall account balance is up more than\\n12.1 percent, even considering the deposit at the beginning of May. The weight of the cash flows threw\\noff this calculation.\\nBecause of the problems with dollar-weighted returns, professional investors who analyze investment\\nreturns usually prefer the time-weighted, compound average approach. Still, the dollar-weighted return\\nhas some value, especially for an investor who wants to know how the asset value has changed over\\ntime. Because a day trader is usually both an investor and an account owner, the dollar-weighted rate of\\nreturn can show whether the investment performance is affecting spending power. This measure is\\nparticularly useful if you are trying to decide whether to continue day trading.\\n Just as you have alternatives in calculating your performance, so too does anyone trying to sell\\nyou a trading system or training course. Ask questions about the performance calculation method\\nand how cash flows and expenses are handled. The numbers may not look so great once you grade\\nthe math behind them.\\nDetermining the risk to your return\\nNow that you have return numbers from your profit and loss statements and your return calculations, it's\\ntime to perform black-belt performance jujitsu and determine your risk levels. I'm not going to go into\\nall of the many risk and volatility measures out there, because believe me, the good editors of the For\\nDummies books don't want to proofread all the math. In fact, some of these measures may be more math\\nthan you want to do. That's okay. Even if you look at just a few measures, you'll have more information\\nthan if you ignore them all.\\nBatting average — er , win-loss percentage\\nBaseball players are judged by how often they hit the ball. After all, they can't score until they get on\\nbase, and they can't get on base without a hit or a walk. The number of hits relative to the number of\\ntimes at bat is the batting average. It's a simple, beautiful number.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 209}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"210Day traders often calculate their batting average, too, although they may call it their win-loss percentage\\nor win ratio. It's the same: the number of successful trades to the total number of trades. Not all trades\\nhave to work out for you to make money, but the more often the trades work for you, the better your\\noverall performance is likely to be. If you have both good performance and a high batting average, then\\nyour strategy may have less risk than one that relies on just a handful of home run trades amidst a bunch\\nof strikeouts.\\nStandard deviation\\nWant something harder than your batting average? Turn to standard deviation, which is tricky to\\ncalculate without a spreadsheet but forms the core of many risk measures out there.\\nThe standard deviation calculation starts with the average return over a given time period. This is the\\nexpected return, the return that, on average, you get if you stick with your trading strategy. But any\\ngiven week, month, or year, the return may be very different from what you expect. The more likely you\\nare to get what you expect, the less risk you take. Insured bank savings accounts pay a low interest rate,\\nbut the rate is guaranteed. Day trading offers the potential for much higher returns but also the\\npossibility that you could lose everything any one month — especially if you can't stick to your trading\\ndiscipline.\\nThe explanation is a lot easier to understand after you take a gander at Figure 16-6.\\nFigure 16-6:  Calculating standard deviation.\\nAs this figure shows, you calculate standard deviation through a series of steps:\\n1. Take every return over the time period and then find the average. A simple mean will do. Here,\\nthere are 12 months, so I added all 12 returns and then divided by 12.\\n2. Subtract the average from each of the 12 returns. This calculation shows how much any one\\nreturn differs from the average, to give you a sense of how much the returns can go back and forth.\\n3. Square the differences you found in Step 2 (multiply them by themselves) to get rid of the\\nnegative numbers. When you add those up, you get a number known in statistics as the sum of the\\nsquares.\\n4. Find the average of the sum of the squares.\\n5. Calculate the square root of the average of the sum of the squares. That square root from this\\nstep is the standard deviation, the magic number you're looking for.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 210}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"21 1Of course, you don't have to do all of this math. Almost all trading software calculates standard\\ndeviation automatically, but at least you now know where the calculation comes from.\\n The higher the standard deviation, the riskier the strategy. This number can help you determine\\nhow comfortable you are with different trading techniques you may be backtesting, as well as\\nwhether you want to stick with your current strategy.\\nIn academic terms, risk is the likelihood of getting any return other than the return you expect. To most\\nnormal human beings, there's no risk in getting more than you expect; the problem is in getting less of a\\nreturn than you were counting on. This is a key limitation of risk evaluation. Of course, a few periods of\\nbetter-than-expected returns are often followed by a run of worse-than-expected returns as performance\\nreverts to the mean.\\n The truism that past performance is no indicator of future results applies to risk as well as to\\nreturn.\\nUsing benchmarks to evaluate your performance\\nTo understand your performance numbers, you need one more step: what your performance is relative\\nto what else you could be doing with your money. The following sections have the details.\\nPerformance relative to an index\\nThe most common way to think about investment performance is relative to a market index. These are\\nthe measures of the overall market that are quoted all the time in the news, such as the Standard &\\nPoor's 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only are these widely watched, but many mutual\\nfunds and futures contracts are designed to mimic their performance. That means investors can always\\ndo at least as well as the index itself, if their investment objectives call for exposure to that part of the\\nbroad investment market.\\n One big problem is that day traders often look at the wrong index for the type of investment\\nthat they have. They'll compare the performance of trading in agricultural commodities to the\\nStandard & Poor's 500 when a commodities index would be a better measure. And the indexes\\nassume that the assets in question are held for the long haul rather than traded every few minutes\\nor every few hours.\\nIf you aren't sure what index to use, check a financial website such as Yahoo! Finance\\n(http://finance.yahoo.com/indices) or check out the Market Lab section of Barron's\\n(www.barrons.com), a weekly financial publication put out by Dow Jones & Company, the same\\npeople who publish The Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Both of these have\\nlengthy lists of different stock, bond, and commodity indexes covering the United States and the world.\\nYou can find the one that best matches your preferred markets and use it to compare your performance.\\n In some cases, your trading practices may overlap more than one index. If so, pick the indexes\\nthat are appropriate and compare them only to those trades that match. If you trade 40 percent\\ncurrencies and 60 percent metals, then you should create your own hybrid index that's 40 percent\\ncurrencies and 60 percent metals.\\nPerformance relative to your time\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 211}),\n",

If your hourly wage is less than what you can earn elsewhere, you\\nmay want to consider doing just that.\\nOf course, there are benefits to working on your own that don't often show up in your bank account.

       " Document(page_content=\"213Chapter 17\\nDay T rading for Investors\\nIn This Chapter\\n Developing the trader's discipline\\n Marking market momentum\\n Seeing when trading strategies are the best move\\nIt takes a special person to be a day trader — one who has quick reflexes, a strong stomach, and a short-\\nterm perspective on the markets. Not everyone's meant to parcel out his or her workday a minute at a\\ntime. Most people do better with a long-term perspective on their finances, looking to match their\\ninvestments with their goals and thinking about their investment performance over months or years\\nrather than right now.\\nBut patient long-term investors can learn a thing or two from the frenetic day trader, and that's what this\\nchapter is all about. Many day-trading techniques can help swing traders, position traders, and investors\\n— people who hold positions for days, months, or even decades — improve their returns and make\\nsmarter decisions when it comes time to buy or sell. In this chapter, I cover some trading and analysis\\ntechniques used by day traders that can help longer-term investors improve their returns. Then I discuss\\nsome ways that long-term investors may want to add day trading to their list of tricks as a way to\\nachieve a better total return.\\nWhat Investors Can Learn from T raders\\nIn theory, investors may be willing to wait forever to see great stock picks play out, but in reality, they\\nonly have so much time and money. A company's stock may be ridiculously cheap, but the stock can\\nlanguish a long time before everyone else catches on and bids the price up. The investor who buys and\\nsells well can add a few extra dollars to his investment return, and who doesn't want that? In addition,\\nsome long-term investors will take a day-trading flyer on a hot idea. Maybe a few will even want to\\ngive day trading a try, especially for those securities they've followed long enough to know how the\\nmarket reacts to news and whether those reactions are appropriate. For a long-term investor, given the\\ntime to test strategies and set limits, day trading in known markets may result in some nice incremental\\nshort-term returns.\\nInvestors who are interested in occasionally (or frequently) day trading need to adopt not only a few key\\nday-trading strategies but also the key characteristics that make day traders successful.\\nBeing disciplined\\nSuccessful day traders have an innate sense of discipline. They know when to commit more money to a\\ntrade and when to cut their losses and close shop for the day.\\nUnfortunately, a lot of long-term investors can get sloppy. They have done so much research and\\ncommitted so much time waiting for a position to work that they often forget the cardinal rule of the\\ntrader: The market doesn't know that you're in it. The stock doesn't know you own it, so it's not going to\\nreward your loyalty. Securities go up and down every day for no good reason, and sometimes you are\\ngoing to make a mistake and will have to cut your losses. There's no shame in that, as long as you learn\\nfrom it.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 213}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"214Now, how can you get that discipline? By doing these things:\\nDevelop an investment and trading plan, covered in Chapter 2. Although investing is probably\\nnot your primary occupation, you do want to have in writing what your objectives are and how you\\nplan to meet them given other constraints: time, tax considerations, and risk tolerance.\\nCarefully evaluate your performance (covered in Chapter 16). Keep a trading diary so that you\\nknow what you're trading and why. Can you find ways to improve? Are you making mistakes that\\ncan be avoided?\\n Set up a sell rule. A quick way for an investor to improve her trading discipline is to set\\nup a sell rule, a rule that tells her when to cut her losses and move on. For example, if a stock is\\ndown 20 percent from where it was purchased or where it traded at the beginning of the year, it may\\nbe time to sell, regardless of what you hope it will do.\\nTraders have to go through these exercises to survive. Investors often skip these steps, but they\\nshouldn't.\\nDealing with breaking news and breaking markets\\nOne reason that the markets are so volatile is that they respond to news events. Prices reflect\\ninformation, changing when any little bit of information comes into the market — even if the info is just\\nthat someone wants to buy and someone wants to sell right now. The problem is that sometimes the\\nmarket participants don't react in proportion to the news they receive. Good traders have an almost\\ninnate ability to discern news that creates a buy from news that creates a sell. (You can find out more\\nabout market indicators and strategies in Chapter 8.) Sometimes traders want to go with the market, and\\nsometimes they want to go against it.\\nWhen your investment idea has been affected by a news announcement, you need to consider how your\\nposition — and you — will react. After all, no matter how long your time horizon and how careful your\\nresearch, things happen to companies: CEOs have heart attacks, major products are found to be\\ndefective, financial statements turn out to be fraudulent, and so on. How are you going to respond?\\nThe first point is that you have to respond. The market doesn't know your position, and the market\\ndoesn't care. (Have I mentioned that already?) You need to assess the situation and decide what to do.\\nGiven the information, is it time to buy, sell, or stay put? Holding your long-term position in the face of\\nlong-term news is often okay, but that decision should be an active one, not a fallback. The trick is to be\\nobjective, which isn't easy when real dollars are at stake.\\n Successful day traders are able to keep their emotions under control and keep the market\\nseparate from the rest of their lives. Good investors should be able to do the same. Chapter 14 has\\nsome ideas that may help.\\nWhen evaluating news, day traders look at how the news is different from expectations. Investors can\\nalso consider how the news is different relative to the known facts about the company to date. For\\nexample, suppose that the Timely Timer Company is expected to report earnings of $0.10 per share.\\nInstead, the news hits the tape saying that earnings will be only $0.05 because of accounting charges.\\nThe trader may see that the earnings are below expectations and short the shares to play on the bad\\nnews. The investor may know that the accounting charges were expected and quickly buy more shares\\nwhile the price is depressed. The fact that there is a way for a buyer and a seller to match their differing\\nneeds is the whole reason that the financial markets exist!\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 214}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"215\\n To a day trader, perception is reality. To a keen-eyed investor, the difference between\\nperception and reality may be an opportunity to make money.\\nDay traders have to think about the psychology of the market because everything moves so quickly.\\nInvestors sometimes forget about psychology because they can wait for logic to prevail. When it comes\\ntime to place a buy or sell order, however, understanding the psychological climate that day can give the\\ninvestor a price advantage, and every bit of profit improvement goes straight to the bottom line.\\n Day traders keep their sanity by closing out positions at the end of the day so that they can get\\non with their lives until the next market opens. Investors, on the other hand, may want to know\\nwhat's happening to their positions at other times. Many brokerage firms offer mobile-phone alert\\nservices, which I think are a terrible idea for a day trader but may not be a bad idea for an investor.\\nSetting targets and limits\\nGood day traders set limits. They often place stop and limit orders to automatically close out their\\npositions when they reach a certain price level. They have profit targets in mind and know how much\\nthey're willing to risk in the pursuit of those gains.\\nGood investors should set similar limits. It can be harder for them, because they have often done so\\nmuch research that they feel almost clairvoyant. Why worry about the downside when the research\\nshows that the stock has to go up?\\nWell, the research may overlook certain realities. And even with thorough analysis, things change.\\nThat's why even the most ardent fundamentalist needs to have a downside risk limit. In most cases, stop\\nand limit orders are bad ideas for a long-term investor because they force the sale of a security during a\\nshort-term market fluctuation and force the sale when it's really a good time to buy more. Investors have\\na different risk profile than day traders, so they need to manage risk differently — but they do still need\\nto manage it.\\n With a stop order, the broker buys or sells the security as soon as a pre-determined price is met,\\neven if the price quickly moves back to where it was before the order took effect. A limit order is\\nonly executed if the security hits the predetermined level, and it stays in effect only if the price is\\nat that level or lower (for a buy limit order) or at that level or higher (for a sell limit order).\\nDay traders close out their positions at the end of each day, so they rarely review their limits. A swing\\ntrader or an investor, on the other hand, who holds for a longer period of time, needs to review those\\nlimits frequently. How much should a position move each month, quarter, or year before it's time to\\ncover losses or cash out with a profit? How has the security changed over time, and do the limits need to\\nchange with it?\\nWhen the position is working, an investor thinks of letting it ride forever. But, alas, few investments\\nwork that long into the future, so the investor also needs to think in term of relative performance. Has\\nthe time come to sell and put the money into something else with greater potential?\\nWhen managing money, day traders usually think about maximizing return while minimizing the risk of\\nruin. For an investor, the goal is maximizing return relative to a list of long-term objectives, including a\\ntarget for risk. But because long-term objectives change, the portfolio has to as well. That means that a\\nposition that has been working out fine may have to be changed in order to meet the new portfolio\\ngoals.

       " Document(page_content=\"216successful day traders, successful investors have a plan for how they will allocate their money among\\ndifferent investments, and they adjust it as necessary.\\n Although investing is a long-term proposition and lacks the frenzy of trading, it is still an\\nactive endeavor. Instead of putting energy into buying and selling, the investor puts it into\\nmonitoring.\\nJudging execution quality\\nDay traders rely on outstanding trade execution from their brokers. They need to keep costs as low as\\npossible in order to clear a profit from their trading, especially because their profits are relatively small.\\nInvestors may have a greater likelihood of making a profit, given that they are waiting for a position to\\nwork out rather than closing it out every night. Even then, better execution leads to better profits. The\\nmagnitude of the few extra cents may be smaller relative to the entire profit, but it still counts.\\nLooking at total execution costs\\nYour broker makes money three ways. The first is on the commission charged to make the trade. The\\nsecond is on the bid-ask spread (also called the bid-offer), which is the difference between the price that\\nthe broker buys the security from customers and the price that the broker sells it to customers. The third\\nis any price appreciation on the security between when the broker acquired it and when the firm sold it\\nto the customer. Because three sources of profit are available, some brokers don't even charge\\ncommission. But note that the broker can still make money — lots of money — even without a\\ncommission.\\n When choosing a broker, consider total execution costs, not just commission. Some brokers\\noffering deep commission discounts make money from high levels of trading volume, but others\\nmake their money from execution.\\nImproving execution\\nThe broker has a few tricks for improving execution. The first is to invest heavily in information\\nsystems that can route and match orders, because even the slightest delay can make a difference if the\\nmarkets are moving. The second is to have a large enough customer base to be able to match customer\\norders quickly. Third, and most important, is to decide that execution is a strategic advantage it can use\\nto keep customers happy. Many brokerage firms would rather concentrate on research, financial\\nplanning, customer service, or other offerings to keep customers happy instead of offering excellent\\nexecution.\\nIn general, a firm that offers low commissions and emphasizes its services to active traders has better\\nexecution than a firm that emphasizes its full-service research and advisory expertise. But there are\\nexceptions, and in some cases, the exceptions vary with account size.\\nBrokerage firms use several numbers to evaluate their execution, including the following:\\nAverage execution speed: This is the amount of time it takes the firm to fill the first share of an\\norder. Firms also track — and sometimes disclose — how long filling an entire order takes, on\\naverage.\\nPrice relative to National Best Bid or Offer: At any time, there is a list of bid and ask prices in\\nthe market, and your broker may not have the best spread. The National Best Bid or Offer is the\\nbest price in the market. You may not be able to get this price for all sorts of reasons, usually\\nbecause of the number of shares you want to buy or sell. For example, if the best bid is for 100\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 216}),\n",

Brokerage firms\\ntrack and report how close the price you received was to the best bid or offer at the time.\\nPrice improvement: Most brokerage firms buy and sell securities for their own accounts. In fact,\\nworking as a trader at a brokerage firm may be a great alternative to day trading. Because the firm\\nmay own the security or want it for its own account, it may give you a slightly better price than\\nwhat's in the market.\\nAverage effective spread: This number measures how much the spread between the bid and the\\noffer differed from the National Best Bid or Offer, on average. The lower the average effective\\nspread, the better.\\n Brokerage firms have to disclose information monthly about the differences between market\\norders and public price quotes and the size of effective spreads in different securities. You can\\nlook up this info to help compare the performance at different firms. Certainly, your results will\\nvary based on what types of securities you're trading, what market conditions are like when you\\nare trading, and how big an account you have with the firm. But investigating the averages for a\\nbrokerage firm can help long-term investors decide whether changing firms to improve profits\\nmakes sense.\\nSo what can you do to improve your execution? Here are three suggestions:\\nAsk the brokerage firm for its policies. The firm should provide this information, as well as give\\nyou some of its recent data, so that you can decide whether the total value of the firm's services\\nmatches the total cost.\\nCheck the weekly “Electronic Trader” column in Barron's as well as the magazine's annual\\nreview of online brokerage firms. Execution cost is a key component of Barron's evaluation.\\nUpdate your own hardware and Internet connection so that they're as fast as possible. If\\nyou're a day trader, having access to good data is imperative (see Chapter 12 for more information\\non your equipment needs). If you are not a day trader but actively manage your investment account,\\nyou may want to consider an upgrade as well. A few seconds can make a difference.\\nApplying Momentum\\nMomentum investors look for securities that are going up in price, especially if accompanied by\\nacceleration in underlying growth. In a sense, they are looking for the same thing day traders are — a\\nsecurity that is going to move big — but they have the expectation of making money over a longer\\nperiod of time. The thought is that a security starting to go up in price will keep going up unless\\nsomething dramatic happens to change it. In the meantime, plenty of money can be made.\\n In momentum investing, instead of buying low and selling high, the goal is to buy high and sell\\neven higher.\\nLike most investors, a momentum investor starts with careful fundamental analysis (described in\\nChapter 7), analyzing a security to determine what will make it go up. Then the momentum investor\\nlooks for certain technical and market indicators, similar to those described in Chapters 7 and 8 and\\nused by day traders. In addition, some momentum investors rely on chart services, especially the Value\\nLine and William O'Neil charts, to help them identify securities that are likely to have momentum.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 217}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"218Earnings momentum\\nEarnings momentum is the province of the investor, not the trader. The investor is looking at the\\nearnings that a company reports every quarter to see whether the earnings are going up at a faster rate,\\nsay from a steady rate of 10 percent a year to 12, 13, or more. Such an increase often happens because\\nof a new technology or product that turns a decent company into a hot property in the stock and options\\nmarkets. If the earning growth rate is accelerating, then the underlying price should go up at an\\naccelerating rate, too.\\nDay traders don't look for earnings momentum, but they do look for price momentum. The two are\\nusually related.\\nPrice momentum\\nWhen a security goes up in price, especially at a fast clip with strong demand underneath it, it is said to\\nhave price momentum. Most day traders are looking for price momentum in order to make a swift profit.\\nMany long-term investors should look for price momentum, too, in order to avoid being stuck with a\\nposition for months before it starts to move. After all, patience pays, but it pays even better if your\\nmoney is working for you while you wait.\\nMany momentum traders don't care why something is going up in price; they only know that it is going\\nup and that they can profit by being there for even part of the ride. Following are some of the different\\nindicators that these traders look at:\\nRelative strength: You can calculate relative strength in different ways, discussed in Chapter 7, but\\nthe basic idea is that a security that's going up faster than the market as a whole is showing\\nmomentum and may be a buy.\\nMoving average convergence/divergence (MACD): This indicator looks at how the average price\\nof the security is changing over time. Is the indicator staying relatively level, meaning that the price\\nis moving slowly back and forth, or is the indicator gradually going up, meaning that the price is\\ngradually going up, too? If you plot the moving average against the actual price levels, a wide gap\\nmeans that the security is moving up or down faster than the average, and if it's moving up, you'd\\nprobably want to buy it. (Otherwise, consider shorting the security; you can read more about that in\\nChapter 9.)\\nStochastics index: This index is the difference between the high and the low price for a security\\nover a given time period. Some analysts look at days, some at weeks. The idea is that, if the\\ndifference is getting bigger, it may be because the security is moving up or down in price at a faster\\nthan normal rate, creating an opportunity for a momentum buyer.\\n At an extreme, momentum investing leads to bubbles, like the infamous dot-com bubble in the\\nlate 1990s. People were buying the stocks because they were going up, not because they\\nnecessarily thought that the businesses were worth much. This run was fun while it lasted, but a\\nlot of people lost a lot of money when reality set in during March and April 2000. The same thing\\nhappened in the real estate market. People were playing momentum when they were flipping\\ncondominiums in Las Vegas in the first decade of the 21st century, but prices couldn't go up\\nforever — and they didn't.\\nFor investors only: Momentum-research systems\\nMany day traders rely on different research systems to help them identify buy and sell opportunities in\\nthe course of a trading day.

The\\nhigher the stock is on the timeliness ranking, the better it is to buy or hold it now.

In addition, many libraries subscribe to Value\\nLine's print service or online database, so you may be able to get access that way.

The\\ncompany's data services are available only to large institutional investors, such as mutual-fund and\\ninsurance companies, but between the book and the newspaper, individual investors can learn a lot\\nabout identifying momentum to pick good times to buy or sell a stock.\\n Many traders — in all securities, not just stocks — find Investor's Business Daily to be at least\\nas useful as The Wall Street Journal, because it looks at the markets from a short-term trading\\nperspective more than from a long-term, business-management angle.\\nThe company's ranking system is based on what it calls CAN SLIM, which is a mnemonic for a list of\\ncriteria that a good stock should meet.

The following sections explain these reasons in more detail.\\n Don't try riskier trading strategies unless your portfolio can handle the risk. As with full-time\\nday trading, engage in part-time and occasional trading strategies only with risk capital, money\\nthat you can afford to lose. Money needed to pay the mortgage this month or pay for retirement in\\n30 years is not risk capital.\\nThe idea has a short shelf life\\nCertain circumstances turn every long-term investor into a trader once or twice: He buys a security\\nintending to hold it forever, and within a few days or weeks, some really bad news comes out. Or he\\nbuys only to see two days later that the company is being sold. That great long-term buy-and-hold idea\\nno longer fits the original parameters, so it's time to sell. Despite the goal of holding forever, the\\ninvestor decides to get out and move on, even if it's only a day later.\\nYour research shows you some trading opportunities\\nGood investors monitor their holdings, and some become intimate with the nuances of a security's short-\\nterm price movements even though the objective is to hold the position for the long term. An investor\\nwho gets a feel for the trading patterns of a specific holding may want to turn that into swing-trading\\nand day-trading opportunities. Yes, doing so adds risk to the portfolio (and the risks of day trading are\\ncovered extensively throughout this book), but it can also increase return.\\nFor example, suppose that an investor who is fascinated with technology stocks notices that the stocks\\nalways rise in price right before big industry conferences and then fall when the conference is over. She\\nmay not want to change any of her portfolio holdings based on this observation, but she may want a\\nway to profit. So she buys call options on big technology companies before the conference and then\\nsells them on the meeting's first day. That short-term trade allows her to capture benefits of the price\\nrun-up without affecting her portfolio position.\\nYou see some great short opportunities\\nShort selling allows a trader to profit from a decline in the price of a security. The trader enters the\\norder, which automatically arranges the loan of a security from the broker followed by a sale in the\\nmarket. The trader then waits in hopes that the price will go down. When it does, the trader buys the\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 220}),\n",

Traders\\nwho sell short are usually looking for a relatively short-term profit, not necessarily over a single day but\\nover months rather than years.\\nIn addition to the interest, short selling faces another risk, which is that the security can go up in price\\nwhile the trader is waiting for it to go down. To reduce that risk, most short sellers do careful research to\\nmake sure that they're right about the security being all wrong. And who else does careful research?\\nMany long-term investors.\\nFor the investor who loves to do research and has some appetite for risk, short selling is a way to make\\nmoney from securities that would make terrible long-term holdings because it seems obvious that they\\naren't going to do well.

It requires a strong,\\ndecisive personality who wants to be running the show every step of the way. And because those profits\\naren't steady, good day traders have some financial cushion and good personal support systems to get\\nthem through the tough times. In this chapter, I list ten really good reasons to take up day trading. (For\\nbalance, I cover ten bad reasons in Chapter 19.) Think you have what it takes? See how many of these\\ncharacteristics fit your life right now.\\nYou Love Being Independent\\nDay trading is like owning any small business. You're the boss and you call the shots. Each day's\\nsuccesses — and failures — are due to you and you alone. The market is irrelevant because you can't\\ncontrol it. Working by yourself all day, you're responsible for everything from the temperature in the\\noffice to the functioning of the computers to the accounting for trades.\\nGood day traders are independent. They don't want someone to tell them what to do; they want to figure\\nit out for themselves. They love a challenge, whether it's finding a good bargain on office supplies or\\ndeveloping a profitable way to arbitrage currency prices.\\nIf you would like to work for yourself and control your own destiny, keep reading. Day trading may be\\nfor you.\\nYou W ant to W ork Anywhere Y ou Like\\nAs a day trader, you have the luxury of setting up shop wherever you please. All you need is an account\\nwith an online brokerage firm and high-speed Internet access. You don't even need a computer if you\\nhave a smart phone. Nowadays you can find these tools almost anywhere: at home, at the library, in a\\nbar, in a big city, in a small town, in the mountains, or in another country. Day trading offers a lot of\\ngeographic flexibility, which few other businesses do. You can trade while traveling as easily as you\\nwould trade at home — especially as mobile service improves.\\nYou're Comfortable with T echnology\\nThe financial-services industry was one of the first to embrace computer technology in a big way, back\\nin the 1960s, and it is still a technology-intensive industry. The people in colored cotton jackets running\\naround the exchange floor, waving their hands and yelling at each other, are anachronisms.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 224}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"225Day traders use software to develop and refine their trading strategies. They trade online using\\nprograms to monitor and automate their trades. They track their trades in spreadsheets and other\\nsoftware. They spend their days in front of a screen, communicating online with other traders all over\\nthe world. They interact with computers, not human beings, during the trading day.\\nDay traders are also self-employed, and many work from home. That means that if their software\\ncrashes, they have to fix it. They have to handle the upgrades, install the firewalls, and back up the data.\\nSure, you can pay someone to do these tasks, but the tech consultant probably won't be able to drop\\neverything to get you up and trading again immediately. Hence, good day traders are comfortable with\\ntechnology. If you like to mess around with programs, don't mind maintaining your computer, and\\nunderstand how to set up your hardware for maximum efficiency, you're in good shape for day trading.\\n(Chapter 12 has some more on this, too.)\\nYou W ant to Eat What Y ou Kill\\nYou don't have to be a self-employed day trader to trade securities. Brokerage firms, hedge funds, and\\nexchange traders employ people to trade for them. In fact, most securities trading takes place through\\nsuch larger organizations. But maybe you don't want to share your profits with someone else. Maybe\\nyou don't want someone dictating your strategy, placing limits on your trades, or determining your\\nbonus based as much on factors such as teamwork and firm profitability as on what you brought in. You\\nwant to “eat what you kill,” as they say, and day trading is one way you can do that.\\nWhen you day trade, you're responsible for your profits and your losses. That means that you reap the\\nrewards and you don't have to share them with anyone else. It's a powerful incentive for independent\\npeople.\\nYou Love the Markets\\nGood day traders have always been fascinated with the markets and how they move. If you watch\\nCNBC for fun and have been following the securities business for years, no matter what your day jobs\\nhave been, then you may be a good candidate for day trading. Of course, I hope you've picked up more\\nthan “some people make a lot of money doing this!” A lengthy immersion in the cycles and systems that\\ndrive securities prices can help you develop trading strategies and know what you are up against.\\nAnd the markets are amazing, aren't they? All the buyers and sellers with all their different needs come\\ntogether and find the price that gets the deal done. The prices assimilate all kinds of information about\\nthe state of the world, the desires of the people trading, and the future expectations for the economy. It's\\ncapitalism in its purest form, and watching how it works is almost magical. If you love how the markets\\nwork and want to learn first-hand what they tell you about making money, then by all means keep\\nreading.\\nYou Have Market Experience\\nIf you have never opened an account with a brokerage firm, purchased a stock, or invested in a mutual\\nfund, you may not be suited for day trading. It's not that those activities alone are adequate preparation\\nfor day trading, but they're a start. They can help you understand all that can happen to cause you to\\nmake or lose money.\\n If you haven't made any trades before, don't quit your day job to day trade.

You have to\\ndefine your trading system, see how it would have worked in the past, and test it to see how it works\\nnow. The preparatory work isn't as exciting as actually doing the day trading, because you aren't making\\nreal money, but you're not losing money, either.\\nShort-term trading has a huge potential for loss, and many traders are chasing the exact same ideas. The\\nmore you know about how your strategy works in different market conditions, the better prepared you\\nwill be to act appropriately and profitably.\\nIt can take a long time to find a strategy that works enough of the time to make it worth your while.\\nMany day traders spend months developing, testing, and refining their day-trading strategy. You can\\nread more about the process of strategy testing in Chapter 16.\\n Because backtesting (which lets you test your trading strategy) uses historic prices, you can do\\nmuch of the work on the side, at night, and on weekends, before you start day trading full time. It's\\na good way to get prepared for your trading business while you save your money and make other\\npreparations for your new day-trading venture.\\nYou Are Decisive and Persistent\\nShort-term traders don't have the luxury of thinking too much about what they're doing. Trading has to\\nbecome intuitive. They have to be able to act on what they see when they see it. There's no room for\\nsecond guessing, for hesitation, for choking, or for panic attacks.\\nGood day traders are also persistent. After they find a strategy they trust, they stick with it no matter\\nhow things are going. That's how they're able to buy low and sell high.\\n Even great traders go through bad periods, but if they trust their system and continue to stick\\nwith it, they usually pull out of the bad period, often with money ahead. If you've been able to\\nstick it out when things went wrong other times in your life, you know what to expect when day\\ntrading.\\nYou Can Af ford to Lose Money\\nObviously, you want to make money. That's the whole idea of day trading. But day trading is difficult.\\nMost traders quit in the first year. Some can't take the stress, some lose all their money, and some\\nsimply don't make enough money to make it worth their time.\\nLike any small business, you're taking a risk when you set up shop as a day trader. That risk is easier if\\nyou can afford to lose money. I'm not saying you need to have so much money that you won't miss it\\nwhen it's gone, but you shouldn't be day trading with money you need to live on, any more than you\\nwould open a store or start a law practice with money you need to buy groceries and pay the mortgage.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 226}),\n",

It's also about being able to stick with your trading. If you need\\ncash to pay your bills, you may be tempted to take money out of the market whenever you're doing\\nwell. Doing so may keep you from reinvesting your profits. Plus, by not sticking to your strategy,\\nyour trading capital won't grow as fast. Think of day trading as a way to build a long-term asset, not\\na way to generate a steady stream of current income.\\nYou can stay in the market through the rough times: You know the old saw that the best way to\\nmake money is to buy low and sell high, right? Well, this means that the best time to buy is usually\\nwhen securities prices have been beaten up and you've lost a lot of money. If you can afford some\\nlosses, staying in the game will be easier. Plus, you'll be able to stick to your strategy so that you\\ncan profit big when the market finally turns.\\nYou can better handle the stress of losses: Not all your trades are going to work out. Some days,\\nyou're going to lose money. If you have enough money that you don't fear loss, you can make better\\ndecisions. And you're less likely to panic if you know that you'll still be able to eat, pay your\\nelectric bill, and have a roof to sleep under at night. With sufficient funds, you're better able to view\\nthe markets clearly and follow a winning strategy.\\nTrading is very much a game of psychology. Give yourself an edge by waiting to do it until you can\\nafford to.\\nYou Have a Support System\\nTrading is stressful. The markets gyrate from events that no one can foresee. Things just happen, and no\\none else who's trading cares how these events affect you. It's enough to make you crazy some days, and\\nunfortunately, some traders do get crazy. Alcoholism, depression, divorce, and suicide seem to be\\noccupational hazards for those traders who have trouble separating what's happening in the market with\\nwho they are as people.\\n The securities markets are wonderful mechanisms for bringing together diverse buyers and\\nsellers. They are not wonderful for propping up your ego, helping you through a rough time in\\nyour life, or slipping you a little extra money when you most need it. The markets are not human.\\nThey are ruthless machines designed to generate the best price for the aggregate of the buyers and\\nsellers participating that day. Some days, the markets will be in your favor, and some days, they\\nwill go against you.\\nGood day traders are psychologically strong. They understand how their weaknesses come out when\\nthey are stressed. They have people (good friends and supportive families) and activities (from exercise\\nroutines to hobbies) that help give their brains a break from trading.\\nChapter 14 talks about managing the stress of day trading, and in many ways, I think it's the most\\nimportant chapter in this book.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 227}),\n",

In fact, there's a\\ngreat book called Investing For Dummies, by Eric Tyson (Wiley), that can help.\\nSome people confuse investing with day trading, though, and these two disciplines are not the same. I\\nlist tons of information on the differences in Chapter 4, but here's the condensed version: Day trading\\ninvolves rapid buying and selling of securities to take advantage of small movements in prices. This can\\nbe a successful strategy for part of your investment account, but day trading with all your money is not\\na good idea.\\nBuying and selling securities on your own without being a day trader is entirely possible.

It takes commitment of both time and\\nof money. If you don't have enough time, learning technical patterns is difficult. If you don't have the\\nmoney, you won't be able to work through rough cycles. And there will be rough cycles. That's day\\ntrading's only sure thing.\\n Some day traders are able to trade part time. If you are disciplined, you can be successful as a\\npart-time trader. The key is to close out your positions at the end of your designated trading period\\nas though the market day were ending. If your plan is to trade for two hours a day, then trade for\\ntwo hours a day and no more. Use an alarm clock as your personal trading bell.\\nYou Like W orking As Part of a Group\\nA decade ago, most large cities had day trading offices, called trading arcades, where traders could go\\neach day to buy and sell securities. The big advantage these firms offered was high-speed Internet\\naccess. Now almost everyone can get high-speed Internet access at home, so there's little need for day\\ntraders to go elsewhere, and most of these offices are closed.\\nWorking at home is great for some people. If you prefer camaraderie during the day, like the support of\\na team, and want friendly faces around you, you're likely to be miserable day trading. It's just you and\\nthe market, and the market doesn't have a great sense of humor.\\nYou Can't Be Bothered with the Details of\\nRunning a Business\\nDay traders are small-business people, and their entrepreneurial flair goes beyond making their own buy\\nand sell decisions. They also buy equipment, shop for supplies, and maintain careful income tax\\nrecords. To some, this is exhilarating. No more mean office manager who decides how many and what\\nkind of pens must be used. No more going through hoops and bringing in letters from a doctor to get a\\nfancy ergonomic chair. You're the boss, and if you want it, you can have it.\\nBut to others, all this responsibility is overwhelming. Picking out pens? Creating backup procedures?\\nWorrying about accounting software? It's too much.

Many popular markets are zero-sum games, meaning that for every winner, there's\\na loser. Other markets, such as the stock market, have a positive bias, meaning they have a tendency to\\nincrease in value over time, but you may rarely see big moves in any one day. And the whole point of\\nday trading is to close your positions each night. Most day traders lose money, in part because they\\nmake obvious, avoidable mistakes.\\nThis list of ten mistakes can help you avoid the most serious ones. Avoiding these mistakes is no\\nguarantee that you'll make money trading, but it can certainly reduce your risk and improve your odds.\\nAnd that's half the battle.\\nStarting with Unrealistic Expectations\\nMost day traders lose money. Some research shows that 80 percent of day traders wash out in the first\\nyear. Brokerage firms that deal with day traders are constantly figuring out ways to attract new\\ncustomers, because it is so hard to retain the ones they have for the long term.\\nYes, some traders make money. A few make a lot of money. But they are the exception. Making money\\nday trading is tough, making enough money to cover the value of your time is even tougher. If you go\\ninto trading knowing that it's hard, that you should only risk money that you can afford to lose, and that\\nyou need to think about it as a business, you'll have a leg up on those who think that they've found an\\neasy way to make millions from the comfort of their own home — and who are then stunned to discover\\nthey are broke.\\nStarting without a Business and T rading Plan\\nTrading is a business. When you decide to day trade, you are committing capital to an entrepreneurial\\nbusiness with a high risk of failure. You are no different from your brother-in-law who decided to open\\na sandwich shop franchise, your neighbor who joined a startup company for little salary and lots of\\nequity, or your college buddy who has been trying to make a go of it as a full-commission life insurance\\nsalesman. You are all out on your own, risking your capital in the hope of great success but knowing\\nthat many others doing the same thing fail.\\nSuccessful businesses have business plans, and your trading business is no different. You need to\\nspecify what you are going to trade, when you're going to trade, how you're going to trade, and with\\nhow much money — before you get started. You need to determine what equipment you need, what\\nservices and training you want, and how you will measure your success.

Because you never commit all of your capital to any one trade, no one trade\\ncan shut you down. At times — like when you know you've got a great idea — holding back some cash\\nmay not seem right, but if you plan to trade for the long run, you need to follow your money-\\nmanagement strategy. Otherwise, you'll never be able to get a winning trade that can offset your losses.\\nYou need to have your wits about you to day trade, but you also need to have capital. Chapter 6 has\\nsome great information on cash management, so don't skip it!\\nFailing to Manage Risk\\nDay trading is risky business, and most day traders quit because of losses. (Have I told you that\\nalready?) Even traders who stick with it have many losing trades. That's why they have risk-\\nmanagement systems in place. Their trading plans include stops, which automatically execute buy or\\nsell orders when securities reach predetermined levels. (Stops are discussed in Chapter 2.)\\nThe day trader looking for trouble places orders without thinking about how much of a security to buy\\nor sell at any one time, and she thinks that she'll just know when to sell. And then she second-guesses\\nherself and finds herself with bigger losses than she intended.\\nIf you're going to day trade, be safe. You know what the risks are (that's why you picked up this book),\\nso use the protection offered by stops and sound money management.\\n Most day traders lose money. Don't risk money you can't afford to lose, and plan for the risks\\nthat you take.\\nNot Committing the T ime and Money to Do It\\nRight\\nDay trading is a job. It's a small-business endeavor that requires research and training well in advance of\\nthe first trade. It's not something you can squeeze into an hour a day as a hobby. To do well, you need to\\nset regular hours and have enough money to generate reasonable returns without unreasonable risks.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 233}),\n",

That thinking is a mistake. If you can't dedicate the time necessary\\nto study the markets and understand how you react to them, you will have trouble staying in the trading\\nbusiness.\\nDay trading is a business of frequent trades with small percentage gains and a high potential for loss. If\\nyou have days of losses, a small account will quickly end up with too little money to meet minimum\\norder sizes. Therefore, successful traders start with enough money to last through periods of drawdown\\nand are still able to generate meaningful dollar returns. Consider this: A 1 percent return on $1,000 is\\nequal to $10, but a 1 percent return on $100,000 is $1,000.\\nIf you have more money to begin with, the dollars you make from day trading will seem more real to\\nyou. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers\\ndefine day traders in part as customers with $25,000 in their accounts. If you have $25,000 you can\\nafford to lose, you are more likely to be a successful day trader than if you have only $2,500 — and\\nyou'll be considered to be a day trader, not a dilettante.\\n You are going to lose money. All day traders have bad days, and they are more likely to lose\\nmoney early in their trading careers before they get a feel for the markets and their own reactions\\nto it. If you have enough money when you begin, you can consider these losses to be part of your\\napprenticeship.\\nChasing the Herd\\nEveryone in the market is looking at the same data and the same technical indicators (like those\\ndiscussed in Chapter 7). Good day traders follow market trends but with the goal of being early or on\\ntime. Those who get in late get crushed: They buy too high, or they sell too low. Chasing the herd is\\ntempting, because it's so hard to watch the market move away from you.\\nDay trading requires quick reactions. It's video games and psychology, some people joke, because the\\ntrader who can figure out what others in the market are doing and then click on the mouse button fastest\\nhas a huge advantage. The trader who hesitates or goes along for the ride is likely to be ruined.\\nThere's no easy solution for this. It helps if you know that you are psychologically cut out for day\\ntrading (covered in Chapter 14) and have confidence in the long-term performance of your trading\\nsystem (covered in Chapter 16). But to a big extent, you just have to have some experience in the\\nmarkets to know how your trading system matches what's in your head.\\nSwitching between Research Systems\\nDay traders lose money, at least part of the time. And losing money can cause a day trader to lose trust\\nin his trading system. And many do what seems logical, which is move to a trading system that seems to\\nbe working. The problem is that no system works all the time; if one did, everyone would use it. And\\nsometimes things look worst before they turn. By switching systems whenever things look bad, the\\ntrader never learns the nuances of how a given system works for him. And he's likely to get stuck on\\nanother downtrend, picking up the new system right when the old one starts to work again.\\n Markets go in cycles. No system works all the time, but if you panic and start trying new\\nthings without doing a lot of upfront work, you're likely to make things worse.

Everyone else has to live through a few rough stretches.\\nOvertrading\\nBecause day traders don't hold positions for long periods of time, they rarely enjoy big and profitable\\nprice moves. Instead, they make money from lots of transactions with small profits. They are crazy\\npeople, moving in and out for short periods. But believe it or not, the day trader who trades too much\\nloses out. She won't be in the market for large intra-day moves, and she'll get killed on commissions and\\nother transactions costs.\\nAs paradoxical as it seems, many day traders do better by making fewer trades each day. That way,\\ncommissions and fees take a smaller bite of the profit. One way to profit from fewer trades is with better\\nmoney management, discussed in Chapter 6. A trader who puts money to work appropriately can often\\nmake more money than one who trades frenetically.\\nSticking T oo Long with Losing T rades\\nDay traders are often overcome with fear, doubt, greed, and hope. They are afraid to recognize a loss.\\nThey wonder whether they're good traders. They don't want to pay the commission to get out of the\\nloser. And if the security was a good buy at the higher price, it's surely a better buy now that the price\\nhas gone down. These traders think that if they just keep a positive mental attitude, everything will work\\nout all right in the end.\\nGood traders have systems in place to limit their losses. They use stop orders (Chapter 2) to force\\nthemselves out of bad trades. They would rather put the money to work on a good trade than stick out a\\nbad one.\\n The market doesn't know your position; even if it did, it wouldn't care. Therefore, no amount\\nof wishing and hoping will cause the market to reward you for your patience. If a trade isn't\\nworking, get out. As the man in the musical sings, tomorrow is a latter day.\\nGetting T oo Emotionally Involved\\nTrading is a stressful business. You're up against an impersonal market that moves seemingly at random\\n(and many academics would say that it moves truly at random). It involves money, which to some\\npeople is a way to keep score in life and to others is their primary source of security. Losing trades mean\\na loss of status and a loss of safety. It's no wonder that so many traders are head cases when the entire\\nmarket sometimes seems to be conspiring against you — you specifically.\\nThe best traders are almost Zen-like in their lack of attachment to the market. They are able to remove\\nthemselves from the frenzy of the trading day so that they're not susceptible to fear, doubt, greed, and\\nhope.

That starts with good money management: determining\\nhow much money you will trade, when you will cut your losses, and when you will walk away with\\nmoney in your pocket. If you don't manage your money, you won't be trading long.\\nHere, you get an overview of the key money-management techniques that you should consider as well\\nas one that is a very bad idea. Some of these techniques are simple; no calculation is required, and you\\ncan use them right away. Others involve a little workout with your calculator. A few of these techniques\\nneed your performance history to work, so you can't use them right away, but you can experiment with\\nthem as you build your trade data. (And yes, this is one of the many reasons that traders should keep\\nrecords of trading activity; see Chapter 16.)\\n These days, many brokers include money-management calculators and apps in their trading\\nsystems, so you can enter the parameters that reflect your trading style and your account balance\\nto get the right amount to trade, right away. These calculators remove the guesswork and mystery\\nassociated with some of these techniques — if you use them. Chapter 11 has more information.\\nTaking Money of f the T able\\nHere's the simplest form of money management: When you're up, take the profit rather than waiting to\\nmake even more money. Fight the greed, take the cash, and call it a day.\\nIf you have a week, month, or year with particularly strong profits, take a little money out of your\\ntrading account and put it in a retirement fund, use it to pay off a debt, or move it into a low-risk\\ninvestment to help diversify your high-risk trading activities.\\nEven if you do nothing else, taking profits when you have them can help keep you in the game longer.\\nUsing Stops\\nUnless you're a machine, staying disciplined all the time can be difficult. Humans do goofy things.\\nThat's why there's a simple way to force discipline on your trading to keep your losses from destroying\\nyour trading account: a stop order.\", metadata={'source': 'day_trading_for_dummies.pdf', 'page': 236}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"237A stop order, also called a stop-loss order, is an order to buy or sell a security as soon as it hits a given\\nprice, known as a stop price. The order sits dormant in the broker's computer until the market price hits\\nthe stop, and then the order is executed. This automated action helps you lock in a profit or cut a loss.\\nSome traders don't like stops because on occasion one will be executed on a one-time down trade or\\nwhile a stock is shooting up at price, causing them to leave some money on the table. However, stops\\nare an easy way to force discipline into trading. They can help you manage your money with very little\\nextra effort.\\nYes, some brokers charge an extra commission for a stop order. But it may be worth it.\\nApplying Gann's 10 Percent Rule\\nThe Gann money-management system is part of a complicated system of technical analysis used to\\nidentify good securities trades. The chart system is complex, but the money-management system is\\nsimple. The core of it is a limit on the money placed on any one trade to 10 percent of the account\\nvalue, never more. The dollar value of that 10 percent goes up or down as the account value changes,\\nbut the 10 percent limit ensures that you always have some powder dry to stay in the market.\\nMost traders who follow Gann's 10 percent rule combine it with stops to limit losses.\\n You can't take advantage of a profitable opportunity if you have no money to trade. You can\\nlose everything in your account if you let your losses run.\\nLimiting Y our Losses with the Fixed Fractional\\nSystem\\nThe fixed fractional system is misnamed; it's actually a range of fractions that determine how much of\\nyour trade capital to risk on any one trade. A larger fraction is allocated to less risky trades; a smaller\\nfraction to more risky ones. The calculation can be found in Chapter 6.\\nTo do the calculation, you need to know how much money you can lose on any one trade. The study\\nneeded to determine that amount can go a long way toward improving your trading without getting into\\nthe math. Fixed fractional takes the stop a step further; it helps you limit your losses and pick up more\\nfrom your wins by considering how much to trade along with the potential value of losses and gains.\\nIncreasing Returns with the Fixed-Ratio System\\nThe fixed-ratio system of money management is related to fixed fractional trade sizing. The key\\ndifference is that it looks at accumulated profit rather than total account size. (Accumulated profit is the\\nvalue of the account less the capital that you put into it when you started trading.)\\nThis system was specifically designed for options and futures trading by Ryan Jones, a trader himself.\\nThe goal is to increase returns from winning trades and protect profits from losing ones. The basic\\ncalculation is in Chapter 6.\\nFollowing the Kelly Criterion Formula\\nThe Kelly Criterion is based on some statistical work by mathematicians working at Bell Labs in the\\n1950s.

The casinos changed the rules so that it no longer works at Vegas, but\\nit does work in securities markets.\\nWhat this formula does is ensure that you will never run out of money, so you will always be able to\\nplace yet one more trade. In the real world, of course, you can reach a point where you still have money\\nbut don't have enough to place a trade.\\nThe equation looks at the percentage of trades that are expected to make money (W), the return from a\\nwinning trade, and the ratio of the average gain from a winning trade relative to the average loss of a\\nlosing trade (R). You may not be able to use the Kelly criterion until you have been trading long enough\\nto amass data to use in the equation, but that's okay — you have other choices here!\\nThe Kelly criterion often generates a trade size larger than many traders are willing to use. One\\nalternative is a half Kelly trade, using half of the amount recommended by the equation.\\nFiguring the Amount to T rade with Optimal F\\nOptimal F is another money-management system that needs performance figures to generate an ideal\\ntrade size. It was developed by Ralph Vince, a trader, and it comes up with the ideal fraction of your\\naccount to trade based on your past performance. The calculation changes with every trade, so it's\\nusually done through a spreadsheet or an app.\\nMeasuring Risk and Sizing T rades with Monte\\nCarlo Simulation\\nThe Monte Carlo simulation is another money-management system drawn from gambling. It's used for\\nrisk management in many different businesses, including trading. You enter risk and return parameters\\ninto a computer program, and it tells you the likelihood of total loss and the optimal trade size.\\nThe system can't account for every possible thing that can go wrong, and it requires a lot of computer\\npower — even nowadays. That being said, many trading and brokerage platforms have Monte Carlo\\napplications that can be used to help you measure risk and size trades.\\nTaking a Risk with the Martingale System\\nMartingale is another simple money-management system, no calculator required. It's popular with\\ngamblers and traders alike. You start with a small amount per trade — you get to pick it yourself, but it\\nshould probably be less than 5 percent of your account value. If the trade works, your next trade should\\nbe the same amount. If the trade does not work, then you close it out and place double the amount\\n(double down, as they say) on the next trade so that you win back the loss. That doesn't work? Double\\nagain. After you have a winning trade, go back to the initial amount for your next trade.\\n If you have to double down for a long series of trades, the money involved quickly grows:\\nfrom $2,000, for example, to $4,000, $8,000, $16,000, $32,000, $64,000, and even $128,000 if\\nyou have six losing trades in a row. This is the problem. If you have an infinite amount of money,\\nyou will come out ahead using martingale.
